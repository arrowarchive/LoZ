            <sp><character>Deku Tree </character> In the vast, deep forest of Hyrule... Long have I
                served as the guardian spirit... I am known as the Deku Tree... </sp>
            <stage type="info">A boy named "Link" is seen sleeping inside of a treehouse.</stage>

            <sp><character>Deku Tree </character> The children of the forest, the Kokiri, live here with
                me. Each Kokiri has his or her own guardian fairy. However, there is one boy who
                does not have a fairy... </sp>
            <stage type="info">Link dreams of Hyrule Castle Town amid a rainstorm. The town's
                drawbridge lowers, allowing a horse carrying a girl and a woman to leave. The girl
                looks at Link, who stands outside of the town walls, as the horse gallops out of
                sight.</stage>

            <stage type="info">Soon, a man emerges from the town atop a horse. He raises his left hand,
                    and directs the palm thereof toward Link. The dream ends. Deku Tree 
                Navi... Navi, where art thou? Come hither.... Oh, Navi the fairy... Listen to my
                words, the words of the Deku Tree... Dost thou sense it? The climate of evil
                descending upon this realm... Malevolent forces even now are mustering to attack our
                land of Hyrule... For so long, the Kokiri Forest, the source of life, has stood as a
                barrier, deterring outsiders and maintaining the order of the world... But...before
                this tremendous evil power, even my power is as nothing. It seems the time has come
                for the boy without a fairy to begin his journey... The youth whose destiny it is to
                lead Hyrule to the path of justice and truth... Navi...go now! Find our young friend
                and guide him to me... I do not have much time left. Fly, Navi, fly! The fate of the
                forest, nay, the world, depends upon thee! </stage>
            <stage type="info">Navi leaves the Deku Tree, and looks about within the Kokiri's area
                of the forest. After some difficulties, lastly flying into a fence, Navi arrives at
                Link's treehouse and finds him sleeping.</stage>

            <sp><character>Navi </character> You finally woke up! I'm Navi the fairy! The Great Deku
                Tree asked me to be your partner from now on! Nice to meet you! The Great Deku Tree

                That's great news! I'm so happy for you! Now you're a true Kokiri, Link! Is that
                right? The Great Deku Tree has summoned you? It's quite an honor to talk to the

                    made me pick up the rocks in front of his house. [004] : Hey, let's work on some
                    moves! To jump sideways while {Z} Targeting, press {A} as you move right or
                    left. To do a backflip while {Z} Targeting, press {A} as you move backwards. To
                    do a roll attack while {Z} Targeting, press {A} as you move forward. While you
                    roll, you can avoid damage. If you have your sword ready while {Z} Targeting,
                    you can do a jump attack by pressing {A}! A jump attack does double damage! You
                    can use {Z} Targeting on the stone next to me, so let's practice! [005] :{1} Oh,

                    Deku Tree? What an honor! He may give you a special gift! Tee hee! That's
                    because the Great Deku Tree is our father, the forest guardian, and he gave life
                    to all of us Kokiri! </sp><sp><character>{2}</character> I wonder if the Great Deku tree

                    You and Saria are close friends, so will you help me cut the grass? I'll let you

                have a fairy partner! I'll teach you how to talk to people using your fairy! When a
                fairy flies near a person or thing, press {Z} to look in that direction. If you use
                {Z} Targeting, you can talk to people from a distance, like we're doing now. When

                    you swing, you'll cut vertically. Sign 07 : Switch Targeting If you see a
                    {triangle} icon above an object, you can target it with {Z}. In other words, if
                    you press {Z} when you see [triangle] above an object, you can lock on to it. If
                    you press {Z} again, the lock will either release or it will transfer to the
                    next object with the {triangle} above it. When you have many enemies in your
                    field of view and you want to escape, press {Z} while holding back on {Control
                    Stick} to cancel targeting. You can target the stones next to this sign for
                    practice! Sign 08 : Hole of "Z" Let's go through this small hole! Stand in front
                    of the hole and push {Control Stick} towards it. When the Action Icon shows
                    "Enter," press {A} to crawl into the hole. Pay attention to what the Action Icon
                    says! Sign 09 : View Point with {Z} Targeting When you have no object to look
                    at, you can just look forward with Z} Stop moving and
                        then change the direction you are facing, or hold down {Z} for a little
                        while. This can help you get oriented in the direction you want to face.
                        It's quite convenient! If you hold down {Z}, you can walk sideways
                    while facing straight ahead. Walking sideways can be a very important technique
                    in dungeon corridors. Turn around and try doing this right now. Sign 10 : Visit

                in his hands. If someone with a righteous heart makes a wish, it will lead Hyrule to
                a golden age of prosperity... If someone with an evil mind has his wish granted, the
                world will be consumed by evil...That is what has been told... So, the ancient Sages

                        played this song for Princess Zelda as a lullaby ever since she was a

                this song. Remember, it will help to prove your connection with the Royal Family.

                complete that study! We would have been famous, if that hateful Ganondorf had not

                were not just composers. We had a mission to analyze the mysterious powers of
                Hyrule's Royal Family. Our names would be a part of Hyrule's history if we could
                complete our research! We kept our study extremely secret until we completed it. To
                tell the truth, each of us was studying a different song, one to summon the sun and
                another to summon the moon. If you were really sent by a member of the Royal Family,
                I will tell you about the results of our study. We inscribed it on the royal
                tombstone. As a messenger of the Royal Family, you should show your Royal
                credentials on top of the Triforce mark... Do you want to hear what I said again? </sp>

                you go back to Hyrule Castle Town Market, you should check out the Bazaar. They sell
                the shield you need there. Tell 'em I sent you and they should give you a special
                discount! If you think you're good to go already, don't worry about it. Now, I'd
                like to ask a favor of you. No, I don't expect you to do it just because of the
                great tip I just gave you! I'm just asking! Have you been to the Happy Mask Shop
                that just opened in the Hyrule Castle Town Market? Everyone is talking about it! My
                little boy pesters me for a popular mask, but I don't have time to go there... So,
                could you go and get the mask for me next time you are in the Market? If you don't
                feel like it, that's OK, but... Well, I have no choice, this is my job... ...sigh... </sp>

                on Death Mountain. Look at that huge boulder over there! It blocks the entrance to
                the Dodongo's Cavern, which was once a very important place for us Gorons... But one
                day, many Dodongos suddenly appeared inside the cavern. It became a very dangerous
                place! On top of that, a Gerudo man in black armor used his magic to seal the
                entrance with that boulder! If you want to hear more Goron gossip, head up to our
                city! Goron City is just a little way up on the trail. It won't take much longer to

                that grow in a place like this are extremely rare. If you have the Goron's Bracelet,

                Gorons live on a diet of rocks... And the most delicious and nutritious rocks around
                are found in the Dodongo's Cavern! But that seems like ancient history now... We've

                all, an awakening voice from the Sacred Realm will call those destined to be Sages,
                who dwell in the five temples. One in a deep forest... One on a high mountain... One
                under a vast lake... One within the house of the dead... One inside a goddess of the

                return the light of peace to the world... This is the legend of the temples passed
                down by my people, the Sheikah. I am Sheik. Survivor of the Sheikahs... As I see you
                standing there holding the mythical Master Sword, you really do look like the
                legendary Hero of Time... If you believe the legend, you have no choice. You must
                look for the five temples and awaken the five Sages... One Sage is waiting for the
                time of awakening in the Forest Temple. The Sage is a girl I am sure you know...
                Because of the evil power in the temple, she cannot hear the awakening call from the
                Sacred Realm... Unfortunately, equipped as you currently are, you cannot even enter

                Hey, have you seen your old friends? None of them recognized you with your grown-up
                body, did they? That's because the Kokiri never grow up! Even after seven years,

                might have already guessed, you are not a Kokiri! You are actually a Hylian! I am
                happy to finally reveal this secret to you! Some time ago, before the King of Hyrule
                unified this country, there was a fierce war in our world. One day, to escape from
                the fires of the war, a Hylian mother and her baby boy entered this forbidden
                forest. The mother was gravely injured... Her only choice was to entrust the child
                to the Deku Tree, the guardian spirit of the forest. The Deku Tree could sense that
                this was a child of destiny, whose fare would affect the entire world, so he took
                him into the forest. After the mother passed away, the baby was raised as a Kokiri.
                And now, finally, the day of destiny has come! You are a Hylian, and were always
                bound to leave this forest. And now... You have learned your own destiny... So you
                know what you must do... That's right... You must save the land of Hyrule! Now,
                Link, break the curses on all of the Temples, and return peace to Hyrule!! </sp>

                        have things I want to tell only to you. Please listen. Another unknown
                        legend of the Triforce passed down by the shadow folk, the Sheikahs.... If
                        you would seek the sacred triangle, listen well... The resting place of the
                        sacred triangle, the Sacred Realm, is a mirror that reflects what is in the
                        heart...the heart of one who enters it... If an evil heart, the Realm will
                        become full of evil; if pure, the Realm will become a paradise. The
                        Triforce...the sacred triangle...it is a balance that weighs the three
                        forces</character> Power, Wisdom and Courage. If the heart of the one who
                    holds the sacred triangle has all three forces in balance, that one will gain
                    the True Force to govern all. But, if that one's heart is not in balance, the
                    Triforce will separate into three parts: Power, Wisdom and Courage. Only one
                    part will remain for the one who touched the Triforce... the part representing
                    the force that one most believes in. If that one seeks the True Force, that one
                    must acquire the two lost parts. Those two parts will be held within others
                    chosen by destiny, who will bear the Triforce mark on the backs of their hands.
                    Seven years ago, Ganondorf, the King of Thieves, used the door you opened in the
                    Temple of Time and entered the Sacred Realm. But when he laid his hands on the
                    Triforce, the legend came true. The Triforce separated into three parts. Only
                    the Triforce of Power remained in Ganondorf's hand. The strength of the Triforce
                    of Power enabled him to become a mighty, evil king, but his dark ambitions were
                    not satisfied. To gain complete mastery of the world, Ganondorf started looking
                    for those chosen by destiny to hold the two other Triforce parts. The one who
                    holds the Triforce of Courage is... You, Link! And the other, who holds the
                    Triforce of Wisdom...is the seventh Sage, who is destined to be the leader of
                    them all... </sp></sp><stage type="info">The symbol of the Triforce appears upon
                the back of Sheik's left hand, the lower-left triangle shining brighter than the
                others.</stage> <sp><character>Light fills the room, resonating from the Triforce
                    mark. As it fades, Zelda appears in the place of Sheik. Zelda </character> It is
                I, the Princess of Hyrule, Zelda. <sp><character> I apologize for meeting you in
                        disguise, but it was necessary to hide from the King of Evil. Please forgive
                        me... On that day, seven years ago, Ganondorf attacked Hyrule Castle. I saw
                        you as I was escaping from the castle with my attendant, Impa. I thought I
                        should entrust the Ocarina to you... I thought that would be our best
                        chance... As long as you had the Ocarina in your possession, I thought
                        Ganondorf could never enter the Sacred Realm, but...something I could never
                        expect happened... After you opened the door of time, the Master Sword
                        sealed you away in the Sacred Realm... Your spirit remained in the Sacred
                        Realm... and then the Triforce fell into Ganondorf's hands. he went on to
                        invade the Sacred Realm... Ganondorf had become the Evil King, and the
                        Sacred Realm became a world of evil. All of this is an unfortunate
                        coincidence. I passed myself off as a Sheikah and hoped that you would
                        return. I waited for seven years... And...now you are back. The dark age
                        ruled by Ganondorf the Evil King will end! The six Sages will open the
                        sealed door and lure Ganondorf back into the Sacred Realm. I will then seal
                        the door to the Sacred Realm from this world. Thus, Ganondorf the Evil King
                        will vanish from Hyrule. Link... In order to do this, I need your courage
                        again. Please protect me while I do my part. And here is a weapon that can
                        penetrate the Evil King's defenses... The power given to the chosen ones...
                        The sacred Arrow of Light!!! &lt;game&gt; </character> You got the Light
                    Arrow! Set it to {C} and your arrows will be powered up! The light of justice

            <sp><character> 003 </character> The Great Deku Tree wanted us to go visit the princess at
                Hyrule Castle... Shouldn't we get going?</sp>

            <sp><character>004</character> The girl from the ranch asked us to find her father...I
                wonder where he is?</sp>

            <sp><character>005</character> I wonder where we'll find the princess in this big old
                castle?</sp>

            <sp><character>006</character> What would Saria say if we told her we're going to save
                Hyrule?</sp>

            <sp><character>007</character> Impa said that the Spiritual Stone of Fire is somewhere on
                Death Mountain.</sp>

            <sp><character>009</character> Darunia said that a fairy lives on top of Death Mountain,
                didn't he?</sp>

            <sp><character>011</character> It seems Princess Ruto somehow got inside Jabu-Jabu's

                worried about Saria, too!</sp>

            <sp><character>018</character> That cloud over Death Mountain...there is something strange
                about it...</sp>

            <sp><character>019</character> An arctic wind is blowing from Zora's River...do you feel
                it?</sp>

                You need a key to open a door that is locked and chained.</sp>
            <sp><character> 003 </character> Hey... Isn't that the same design that's on the Door of

            <sp><character>004</character> Strong iron bars are blocking the door. You can't open them

                the screen!</sp>
            <sp><character>012</character> Look! Something is hanging up there! It looks like an old
                ladder!</sp>
            <sp><character>013</character> After you get into the water, if you hold down {A}. you can

            <sp><character>014</character> Stand next to this block and grab hold of it with {A}. While
                holding {A}, you can push or pull it. If you stand next to the block and press {A}
                while pressing {Control Stick} towards the block, you can climb on top of it. Pay

                technique, isn't it?</sp>
            <sp><character>018</character> With that switch on, the moving platform goes higher. Now you

                    <sp><character>024</character> From here on, we'll be going through some narrow
                passages! If you take it slow, maybe you can sneak up on some enemies. Use {Z}
                Targeting to always look in the proper direction. Set your view so you can see down
                the next corridor before you turn a corner. Once your view is set, hold down {Z} to
                sidestep around the corner. That way you won't be surprised by an enemy waiting in
                ambush.</sp> [ Forest Temple ] <sp><character>025</character> There are arrows painted
                on the floor!</sp>

                saw Darunia?</sp> [ Ice Cavern ] <sp><character>036</character> This blue fire...it
