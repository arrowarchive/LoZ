<sp><character>NARRATION</character>
Long ago, in the kingdom of
Hyrule, a wind sorcerer
named Vaati appeared.

Vaati terrorized the people 
of Hyrule and kidnapped 
many beautiful girls from 
their homes.

When all hope seemed lost,
a young boy carrying 
little more than a 
sword appeared.

According to the legends,
when the boy drew his sword,
he split into four, the
four-who-are-one worked
together to vanquish Vaati.

The hero used his word to 
bind Vaati in a remote area 
in Hyrule.  The people 
christened the blade the Four
Sword and built a shrine 
around it.  There it remained
undisturbed for years.

Ages flowed by...

The wind sorcerer Vaati
broke free of his prison 
and kidnapped Zelda, the
princess of Hyrule.

Princess Zelda's childhood
friend, Link, used the power 
of the Four Sword to defeat
Vaati and seal him away
once again.

And, for a time, the people 
of Hyrule believed that 
their land was safe.

Until...</sp>

VOICE FROM THE LIGHT(TMLN 1)</character>
Link... Link... 
Can you hear my voice?

</sp>
<sp><character>NARRATOR(TMLN 1)</character>
Swiftly and suddenly, dark
clouds covered all of Hyrule.

Ominous clouds that filled 
all those who saw them
with fear...

A sense of dread swept
across the land.</sp>
<sp>
<character>VOICE FROM THE LIGHT</character>
Link...
Hurry to Hyrule Castle...</sp>

<stage type="location">Hyrule Castle</stage>

<sp><character>PRINCESS ZELDA(TMLN 1)</character>
Oh, Link...
It's you!  Thank goodness
you came!

The six maidens who guard 
Hyrule are gathered here in
the castle.

The sky has become so dark
and foreboding...

I'm worried about the seal
that binds the wind
sorcerer Vaati.</sp>
   <sp><character>
VOICE</character>
Princess Zelda!
Come quickly!

</sp>
<sp><character>PRINCESS ZELDA(TMLN 1)</character>
We must hurry.
Come, this way.</sp>

<stage type="location">Maidens Sanctuary</stage>

<sp><character>PRINCESS ZELDA(TMLN 2)</character>
These six maidens guard the
portal to the Four Sword 
Sanctuary to keep it safe.

I'm going now to make sure 
Vaati's seal remains strong.

Now, the shrine maidens and 
I must open the portal to the 
Four Sword's resting place.

Step back, Link...
<stage type="info">Maidens create the portal</stage>

Come with me, Link.
<stage type="info">Gasp, Shadow Link appears</stage>

Ah!

Wh...who are--?

It can't be...
You're...Link?!</sp>

<stage type="info">Shadow Link encapsulates the maidens, disappearing into the portal; Link 
follows him through the portal, to the Four Sword Sanctuary.</stage>

<stage type="location">Four Sword Sanctuary</stage>

<stage type="info">Shadow Link taunts Link into approaching the Four Sword</stage>

<sp><character>NARRATOR(TMLN 2)</character>
This sword guards the seal 
on the wind sorcerer Vaati.

If you draw the sword, you 
must know what will happen.

Will you still draw forth 
the sword?

<choice><interact>No</interact></choice>

<stage type="info">Shadow Link continues to taunt Link, until he approaches it again</stage>

So you accept the fate of the 
one who draws this sword?

<choice><interact>Yes</interact></choice>

<stage type="info">Link pulls it out, splitting into four.  Shadow Link laughs and runs away, but 
as Link tries to pursue him, dark magic spews from the pedestal, and a windy 
cyclone appears, carrying the four Links away.  The sorcerer Vaati appears from 
the pedestal, (in his beastly eyeball form) and cackles.  The screen fades.</stage></sp>

<stage type="info">black screen; flapping wings and owl coos can be heard every once in awhile</stage>

<sp><character>VOICE(TMLN 2)</character>
Link...
You have accepted the
destiny of the hero...

Princess Zelda and the six 
maidens have been taken 
by dark forces.

However, Vaati's magic has
robbed the Four Sword of its 
power to vanquish darkness.

To return the sword to its 
full strength, find the source 
of that power: Force Gems.

Gather Force Gems wherever
they lie, and rescue the 
maidens and Princess Zelda.

         <title>STAGE 3: Hyrule Castle</title>
         <stage>SIGN Tingle Times Volume 1 Tingle had an encounter with a charming lady fairy! It
            was fate! Destiny! I was sneaking along behind her when she went into a castle...and
            never came out! Surely she's been captured, because she's too adorable for her own good!
            If you happen to see Miss Fairy, gaze upon her lovingly for me. Oh...and save her, too!

            perch</stage>


         <sp><character>KAEPORA GAEBORA(TMLN 1)</character> Link! There's a terrible fiend in Hyrule
            Castle. He's leeching power from the maidens little by little. Listen well, Link. To
            rescue the maidens, you must face the fiercest of foes. Keep your wits about you, and be
            wary! <stage type="info">With that, Kaepora Gaebora flies away</stage>
         </sp>
         <sp><character>UGLY CREATURE 1</character> Who... Who is it? Who's there? You... You're not
            with those fiends who have taken over the castle, are you? Please, would you help me? I
            heard the maidens' cries and came running to find the castle a nest of fiends. They
            captured me and split me in two. That's why I look so horrible right now! Please, I beg
            of you. Reunite my two halves! Make me whole again! </sp>
         <sp><character>UGLY CREATURE 2</character> Oh, happy day! Thank you! Now, at last, we can
            merge as one, and I can return to my true form! Please take me to the barrier that
            blocked your way. I'll do my best to aid you on your journey! <stage type="info">When
               you approach the barrier, the two ugly creatures join into one beautiful
               creature</stage> I didn't think I would ever be allowed to reclaim my true form as a

            have noticed us. I'll take care of this! <stage type="info">The Great Fairy twirls
               around and the casts a spell that eradicates all the soldiers</stage> So this is the
            magical barrier that barred your way? Allow me to take care of this. <stage type="info"
               >The barrier is dispelled</stage> I'll let all of my friends throughout Hyrule
            know... "If you run into four travelers with one face, tend to their weariness and ease
            the burden of their travels!" There is a tradition that young, noble gentlemen rescue
            damsels in distress. And so, I leave the well-being of the maidens in your hands. Take
            care! <stage type="info">She disappears from sight</stage>

            been freed, haven't I? Link! What's happened to you? Oh, the Four Sword. You've drawn
            the mystic blade. That means Vaati is free once more, does it not? And you've taken up
            the mantle fate has given you. How brave! Such determination speaks well of you. You are
            truly a great hero. Oh... Oh! There's something you must know! The dark shadow that
            captured us... It looked...just like you! What was it? Link... You must save the
            princess and the remaining maidens! Travel by sea under my protection to a place called
            the Eastern Temple. Another of my kidnapped sisters is imprisoned there. Allow me to
            transform, that I might serve as your guide. Come! We must go!</sp>

            all. It also grants you the power to see the shadowy Dark World. The people of this

            This odd little mage whispered this to me: "The six..." I'm sure it's connected to this
            incident somehow! Don't you forget it! </sp>

            Seeker's Guild? I see... Well then, listen to the information I've gathered. An
            apprentice mage disappeared somewhere around here. POOF! Right when she vanished, she
            whispered something... "Protect..." Now that's suspicious! You would do well to lock
            that away in your head! </sp>

            investigation? That's welcome news! Well then, listen to what I have to tell you! Look!
            The mage is over there, right? I was hiding over here, watching her, when I heard her
            call out suddenly... She said, "Beautiful!" suspicious, isn't it? Maybe it's part of a
            spell or something! What's she up to? </sp>
         <sp><character>SEEKER 4</character> ... ... ... Oh, so now you're a member of the Seeker's
            Guild?! Well then, why don't you listen to the clues I've gathered so far! A weird mage
            is lurking somewhere back here.... I can sometimes hear her talking to herself, and this
            is what she says: "Deeply connected to this village..." That is most definitely a clue!

            doubt she is trembling in fear even now! I don't know much about the guild, but watching

            will you go to the forest? Perhaps you will find some clues there. In the heart of the
            forest is a temple. The Dark Mirror can be found there. Long ago, a dark tribe invaded
            Hyrule. They were defeated and imprisoned within the mirror. The tribe's mirror prison
            was then secreted away and hidden in the forest temple to sever its connection to this
            world. That Dark Mirror must never fall into the hands of those with evil hearts. Link!
            The mirror is a danger in anyone's hands but yours. No one else can be trusted. Retrieve
            the Dark Mirror from the palace, and keep it until Princess Zelda is safe. Please. You
            are the only one we can depend on... First, let us proceed to the forest.</sp>

            That's why I dug a pit to trap 'em! And it looks like I've caught someone in it! C'mon,

            any thieves from escaping! If you want to leave the village, you have to capture ten
            thieves first. All you gotta do is lift the rascals up with the R Button and put 'em in

         <sp><character>OLD MAN WITH CAGE (again) </character> You still have __ thieves left to
            capture. I know their hideout's around here somewhere. Use the R Button to lift 'em up

            very well use the flame from our own fires. Hmm... Gotta do something, or the village is

         <sp><character>DEKU SCRUB 5(TMLN 1)</character> Lord Ganon told us to keep watch for any

            Someone's stolen the Dark Mirror! That mirror reveals the wickedness within a person and
            brings it to life. It's an item of terrible, dark power. No good can come from this.
            Shadow Link!! Could he be your evil reflection, cast by the Dark Mirror? If that were
            the motive of the mirror's thief... This is disastrous! If we don't get the mirror back,

         <sp><character>WHITE MAIDEN(TMLN 2) (fairy form)</character> The whereabouts of the purple

            entered my woods, they spoke of their dark lord. "Ganon, Ganon," they chanted. It was as
            though they were...worshipping. </sp>
         <sp><character>RED MAIDEN(TMLN 3)</character> Ganon... I've heard that name before. No
            wait... It was Ganondorf... But, no... That man was of the Gerudo tribe. I can't imagine
            these creatures worshipping some desert nomad. There's a Gerudo village in the desert. I
            doubt there is any connection, but it cannot hurt to check the village. Beyond the
            village lie ruins and an ancient pyramid. They are so old that no living creature knows
            very much about them. All I can tell you is that no on who sets foot in the pyramid ever
            returns. If one of the maidens is there, I fear for her safety. Link... Despite all of
            this, we must go there. Let us be on our way! To the endless desert sands!</sp>

      <chapter>
         <title>STAGE 1: Desert of Doubt</title>

         <sp><character>RED MAIDEN (fairy form)</character> Take heed, Link. The road you must take
            is enveloped in a fierce wind. But remember how far you've traveled. You must proceed.
            You must go forward. You can meet any obstacle that arises. I believe that. A Gerudo
            village lies due north of here. Go and speak with them. </sp>
         <sp><character>GERUDO(TMLN 1) </character> Welcome. It's been a long time since we've seen
            any travelers here. This village is our home. We are the dwellers in the desert, the
            Gerudo tribe. The village is in a bit of an uproar contending with a man who broke our
            laws. We can't do much for you, but make yourself at home. </sp>
         <sp><character>GERUDO IN TENT(TMLN 2)</character> The pyramid is sacred to our people. To
            have a criminal such as him enter... His presence stains its holy ground. </sp>
         <sp><character>GERUDO IN TENT(TMLN 3)</character> The Desert Temple was built to keep
            people away from the pyramid. None who enter the pyramids or the temple have ever
            returned. They are tombs. Yet the man has gone there by himself. All for the sake of his
            own mad desire! </sp>
         <sp><character>GERUDO IN TENT(TMLN 3)</character> Once every 100 years, a special child is
            born unto my people. That child is destined to be the mighty guardian of the Gerudo and
            the desert. But this child, its heart grew twisted with every passing year. The child
            became a man who hungered for power at any price. </sp>
         <sp><character>GERUDO IN TENT(TMLN 2)</character> Curse that Ganondorf! He broke our laws
            and left for the pyramid... I don't know what he plans, but I am worried... </sp>
         <sp><character>GERUDO IN TENT(TMLN 1)</character> Within this desert, an ancient temple
            slumbers amid ruins. A perpetual sandstorm blows here, a barrier to hinder those who
            seek to enter. If you plunge headlong into the sands, you'll wind up right where you
            started. </sp>
         <sp><character>GERUDO ELDER(TMLN 2)</character> Tell me travelers what brings you to these
            borderlands? Hmm... I see... You came on word of the maidens, eh? Yes, this Ganondorf
            you speak of is a member of the Gerudo. But his intent is unknown to me. He has flouted
            the law and fled for the pyramid. To reach the pyramid, one must first pass the trial of
            the Desert Temple. The villain Ganondorf will no doubt draw his last breath failing this
            trial. We've blocked the road to the desert to keep other fools from coming. But
            considering the crisis in Hyrule, we've no reason to stop you brave lads. Go to the
            entrance of the village and speak to the guards at the gate. </sp>

         <title>STAGE 1: Frozen Hyrule</title>


         <sp><character>SHRINE MAIDENS(TMLN 2) (fairy forms)</character> Link, the Tower of Winds
            has vanished. If we enshrine the royal jewels on the Four Sword's sacred ground, the
            temple may reappear. We'll go on ahead and guard the sacred ground from our foe until
            you arrive. The power of darkness has halted the flow of time here, and winter lingers
            on. We must believe in tomorrow and hold true to our hope. May our passion keep our
            hearts from freezing! Link, you must first seek out the final royal jewel! Then, we will
            go to the Tower of Winds, where Princess Zelda awaits. </sp>
         <stage>SIGN Blizzard Warning! Take care not to stroll out too far during blizzard
            conditions! If you're exposed too long, your strength will fade away. Be careful! </stage>
         <sp><character> DEKU SCRUB</character> Pipiii! It's my incredible creation, the Snow Wall!
            Unless you flame it while in Deku Scrub formation, you can't melt it! In other words,
            guys like you will never be able to get by this wall! I am soooo smooooth! </sp>
         <stage>SIGN Frozen lake! No swimming!</stage>

         <sp><character>PURPLE KNIGHT OF HYRULE(TMLN 1)</character> Heroes! You've done well to get
            this far... I am the Knight of Hyrule charged with guarding the purple royal jewel.
            Thanks to you, we have been freed from the dark spells that bound us. You must now take
            the four royal jewels past this ice-bound temple and fly to sacred grounds! Then you can
            enter the tower leading to the Palace of Winds, where Vaati lurks. Deep within the
            palace which soars above the Realm of the Heavens, a terrible darkness awaits you all.
            Yet if you do not dispel that darkness, true peace will never return to Hyrule. The fate
            of Princess Zelda-- and all of Hyrule--rests in your hands!</sp>

            they may rest in peace.</sp>

         <stage type="info">Defeat Shadow Link!</stage>
         <sp><character>WHITE MAIDEN(TMLN 1) (fairy form)</character> Link, the sacred grounds lie
            within this forest. Preparations are complete. Come, let us proceed. <stage type="info"
               >The six shrine maidens are gathered around a pedestal</stage>
         </sp>
         <sp><character> SHRINE MAIDENS</character> Link... You've returned to where you started,
            the Four Sword Sanctuary. Now, give us the four royal jewels... <stage type="info">The
               four jewels rise from the colored Links and take their place in a pedestal in each
               corner; they start glowing</stage> Hear me, heavens... Hear me, earth... Heed the
            light of the royal jewels enshrined here, and restore to us... the Tower of Winds!!
               <stage type="info">Light comes from the eye picture on the wall and a pillar of light
               restores the green color to the Sanctuary</stage> Link! Climb the tower. You are
            entrusted with Princess Zelda's safety!</sp>

         <sp><character> STONE TABLET</character> OooooOOoo... Strike cracked blocks forcefully from
            above to smash them to bits. Everyone knows that. I didn't know that... No one ever told
            me, and now it's too late... I must leave some kind of record of my mishap before it
            happens to someone else. ...Why did I write out "OooooOOoo"? <stage type="info">A prism
               of light appears after defeating the boss</stage>
         </sp>
         <sp><character>PRINCESS ZELDA(TMLN 1)</character> Link? It is you, isn't it, Link? I
            believed you would come to my rescue, and here you are. I knew you would wield the Four
            Sword and come... Thanks to your efforts the darkness above ground is thinning. The
            maidens and I will pray to keep the darkness from recovering its full strength. However,
            the Realm of the Heavens is now overflowing with Vaati's monsters. The darkness in the
            Realm of the Heavens must be purged if true peace is to return.</sp>

            above, and they'll break. You can also use the momentum of being shot from cannons to do
            the same. Everyone knows that. Except me. That's the first thing I learned when I got
            here. Didn't help me much, though... Urrrrk... </sp>
         <sp><character> STONE TABLET</character> Urrrk... I thought I'd finally made it to

            rescued... those whom the darkness claimed, the Knights of Hyrule, and many others... We

            sorcerer Vaati, eh? Before the Four Sword, you were at your wit's end. Useless cur! I
            did not steal enough power from the Hyruleans. My blood boils, heroes! It seethes at the
            sight of you! I thirst for destruction! For the pure release of rage, the power of
            wrath! Four Sword or no, my trident will reduce you to nothingness! I'm waiting, you
            worms! <stage type="info">A blue shadowy cloud is seen leaving the palace</stage>

            crumbling about us! We must hurry! </sp>

         <sp><character>PRINCESS ZELDA(TMLN 1)</character> What?! That raw patch of darkness, deeper
            than the blackest night... Is... Is that Vaati? No, it's not the wind sorcerer... No
            matter, I must use my power to seal it away! <stage type="info">Zelda attempts to use an
               orb of light to seal it away</stage> Can't breathe... My strength is failing me...
            The very air around me is growing thin...dying... I only need a bit... more power... </sp>

            so-called heroes do not stand even a gnat's chance of harming me! Even if you worms
            attack in a group, I will skewer the lot of you on my mighty trident!! <stage

            The wielder of the trident!! <stage type="info">Zelda makes another orb of light
               energy</stage> Yet now... While Ganon's power has waned... I will pour all of my
            remaining strength into this ball of light! While it is suffused with power, I will
            release it and strike! At that time, use this! <stage type="info">Link receives a
               bow</stage> Fire at the ball of light with all your might! If we combine our powers,
            we may yet be able to seal Ganon away from the world! Link! You must hold back Ganon
            until my ball of light is ready!! </sp>
         <sp><character>GANON(TMLN 2)(with glowing orange aura)</character> Do you think to stop me?
            You have not even a fool's chance of facing my power. Once I am finished here, I shall
            be rid of your Princess Zelda forever! <stage type="info">When you hit Ganon with the
               ball of light, he is suspended in the ball of light; the six shrine maidens appear
               and return to human form around him, casting a light spell</stage>
         </sp>

            King of Darkness! I cannot be destroyed by insects like you! Noooo!!! <stage type="info"
               >The light grows more intense, then goes into the Four Sword. Ganon disappears with
               the light</stage>
         </sp>
         <sp><character>PRINCESS ZELDA(TMLN 3)</character> ... ... Link. We whom you protected, and
            all of Hyrule as well... We will struggle together and grow stronger than before. We
            will work as one, as the four of you have done. We will work...together. Now, the Four
            Sword... Place the sword that sealed away the darkness on the pedestal.</sp>

         <stage type="location">FOUR SWORD SANCTUARY</stage>

         <stage type="info">The shrine maidens and Zelda surround the pedestal. Link comes forth;
            four swords rise up and merge into one, which is then lowers into the pedestal. The
            maidens create a triangular prism around the Four Sword, and then turn into fairies and
            leave. Link and Zelda then exit together. THE END</stage>
