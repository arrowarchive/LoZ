        <h1><i>The Legend of Zelda</i> Text Analysis</h1>
        <h2>The Dark World and The Hero's Descendants Timeline</h2>

        <p>This is a project that will analyze a specific branch of the Zelda Timeline. There are six games in this timeline, but we will be analyzing the games below and comparing them. The reasons for this are at the bottom of the page.</p>

        <ol>
            <li><i>The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time</i></li>
            <li><i>The Legend of Zelda: Majora's Mask</i></li>
            <li><i>The Legend of Zelda: Twilight Princess</i></li>
            <li><i>The Legend of Zelda: Four Swords Adventure</i></li>
        </ol>
        
        <p><strong>Please Note:</strong> There are several games that are a part of the timeline that will not qualify for this assignment. These games are <i>Link's Crossbow Training</i>, <i>Hyrule Warriors</i>, and <i>Breath of the Wild</i>. There are no files containing the text for <i> Crossbow Training</i> and the latter two are recent releases, so we are refraining from those games to avoid potential copyright problems.</p>
        
        <p> Similarly, <i>Skyward Sword</i> and <i>The Minish Cap</i> will be excluded from this assignment because they predate this branch of the timeline. <i>Ocarina of Time</i> predates this branch as well, but it is the breaking off point for the timeline, so it cannot be disqualified. </p>
        
        <p><strong>Designer's Note:</strong> The layout of the website is under construction. I will be working on a wallpaper and (possibly) Jekyll for the layout of the website. I have been practicing HTML and CSS on my own time so I can format this website once our files are marked up. The layout is similar to the template as of the time of writing, but it won't look like this forever. <br />
