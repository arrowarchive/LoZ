        <p>According to the Graph, <i>Ocarina of Time</i> had the most overall events in the timeline. This is a practice graph as of now, so the counts may be incorrect, but I am still trying to find my footing. I will have to view the <i>Twilight Princess</i> file as well, since I know there are items, they are just under a different name.</p>
