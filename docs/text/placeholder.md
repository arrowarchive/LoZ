# Placeholder

To be honest, I've never played a *Zelda* game. I hope that with this project, I can learn more about the project and finally be able to play one!

Actually, I have played a *Zelda* game; It was *Majora's Mask 3D*, but I gave up at the Snowhead Temple. That level was SO frustrating. 

I have *Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild*, but I have not played it yet. I've heard good things about it so I want to play it, but the question is "when?"

I know that I'm rambling, I'm just sick of making placeholder files with nothing in them, especially since my repo has over 500 commits and you can guess how many times I've had to do that
