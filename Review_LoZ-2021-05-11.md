### Project orientation and research questions
The project's landing page (index.html) provides  good idea of which game scripts in the *Legend of Zelda* series you are working with.
It is a little awkward to lead with the DISCLAIMER, before explaining more generally what you are doing, so I would move the DISCLAIMER to the end of the page. In the DISCLAIMER, you indicate that you will "properly cite" the sources for your game scripts, but no sources are provided and nor do you provide links out to them anywhere on the site. This suggests that the team submitted this project in an unfinished state. There are several different sources you might have used for these scripts, and your commenting on their poor or workable quality for this project without providing examples of what you mean is a pretty serious problem from the start.

Further, you are not clear on this page what you intended to analyze. Your research questions should be announced here. 

### Analysis

This is substantiated by one graph on the statistics.html page. The graph is clearly labelled but that doesn't mean your visitors actually understand what it means if they weren't insiders to the project. The text accompanying the graph isn't especially helpful either, again signalling that this project was not finished when it was submitted. When you indicate that "This is a practice graph as of now, so the counts may be incorrect" you leave your visitors wondering what they are looking at. *What* are you counting first of all?  You need to be describing the structure of the game scripts so we understand they are divided into "Acts" and "Chapters" What did you include as "Stage Directions"? Is that what they were actually called in the game script? (No...but why did you call them this?) 

Realize that this graph is based on *your decisions* for your markup. Your decisions are unknown to your visitors, so you need to explain them, to explain the basis of what they are seeing. This is very incomplete.

It is disappointing that we took so much care with the markup of these scripts only to have one graph with an unfinished explanation. Remember how we worked on making sure you could identify all the passages in which game players are presented with choices? Surely you could have counted and taken stock of those, but it seems we did a lot of markup work that was left without analysis. The player choices are mentioned only at the end of the Ocarina of Time write-up, but deserve much more attention in the statistics page.  

### Game discussions
Each game is summarized on its own page, but summary does not really count as analysis, does it? Each page here might contain a table listing information you could pull from XQuery, even simply a list of characters and how frequently they appear. Or even some examples to indicate the kinds of choices presented to the game player would have been more helpful as a study of the games rather than just a plot summary of them. 

## Code description

"Our Code" (our_code.html) presents your code structure and how you attempted to unify it following a shared schema, but there is no explanation of what you hoped to accomplish with this shared schema. How did it help you with analyzing the game scripts in your project? Well, since not much analysis is presented on the project, it is very difficult to tell. 

### Website design and user experience
The website background design is clever, but difficult to work with: Links are colored purple and get hidden against the color scheme. Site navigation is well designed and manageable. And yet style is also content, and content is lacking on this project site. A project that concentrates its energy on visual styling at the expense of content creates an impression of carelessness. Had the site more analytical content, it would have faced more significant design challenges, for example, presenting multiple graphs on a page, and determining where best to place them to assist viewers to understand something.

### Concluding comments
Style cannot be separated from substance. A site that lacks the content it promises cannot be said to be well designed. This team has a strong foundation in its code base to do a great deal of intensive analysis of the Zelda scripts. The care taken with generating a shared schema created a foundation for analytical work, but the team seems not to have taken care with building on that foundation. Perhaps a necessary prerequisite for quality work is simply taking care to follow through on each thing you set out to accomplish. We say to each other, "take care," and perhaps that is an ethic to bring to any project you work on. If you care about it, you keep track of what it needs, you make sure the analysis is present, you find there is great complexity to manage. With greater care from its team, this project could be quite impressive. I wish each of you a project that you care very much about, because that is really when you learn to build and design brilliantly. Perhaps a project like this is a stepping stone toward better quality work in future.
