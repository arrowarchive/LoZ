Purpose, and using the guide, as well as appendix sections including items,

Purpose~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~(0.3)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~


This FAQ was written in response to time line theorists. Indeed, FSA has many 
controversial and conflicting issues with the Zelda timeline, and it remained 
one of the last Zelda games that Gamefaqs did not have a script for.  The guide 
may also be used for casual readers, as all quotes are the chronological order 
that matches the progression of the game.  I also tried to use as many captions 
as possible to describe the events that occur.  Hopefully, a wide range of Zelda
fans will find this guide helpful.

The guide is currently formatted using the same line breaks that the game has.  
Although, if it becomes an issue, I may end up deleting the games line breaks 
for ease of reading.   


~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Using the guide~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~(0.4)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
I decided to use a rating system that would help timeline theorists better 
navigate and find meaningful quotes.  Quotes that I give a rating to will have 
(TMLN X) directly after the name, with X being the rating level.  This way if 
you want to search for important quotes by a specific person, you would type in
"NAME(TMLN" in the search box.  Or if you want to search for a specific rating 
level for a specific person, or all quotes of a certain rating, you would search
"NAME(TMLN X), or (TMLN X) respectively.  Again, X would be either 1, 2, or 3 
with 3 being the highest canon, and 1 being a possible Easter Egg. So if I 
wanted to search for the description of the tri dent, I would search 
"REDMAIDEN(TMLN 2)" with a space in between red and maiden, because I know that
the redmaiden reads the inscription and I know the tri dent is level 2. 
(Note: I'm using irregular spacing so as not to flood the search results)

I realize that doing this in itself is controversial, and could turn out biased,
as someone else might give a certain quote a different rating, but I narrowed it
down to three levels of canon that hopefully can't be disputed.  

LEVEL 3: High-Level Canon
All quotes marked with (TMLN 3) are indisputable Canon that is widely believed 
to be universally concurrent throughout the series.  It also includes elements 
that MUST be tied into the timeline.  This includes the prologue, and epilogue,
Gannon, the Triforce, the Four Sword, and Zelda.  After deliberating awhile, I 
decided the tri dent would be included in this level, as it is widely believed 
to affect the rest of the timeline.  

LEVEL 2: Mid-Level Canon
All quotes marked with (TMLN 2) are large factors to take into consideration 
when constructing a timeline.  This level will include canonical elements that 
impact the construction of many people's timelines, but sometimes not others. 
This includes new storyline elements that are unique to FSA, but could very well
be expanded on in future Zelda games.  Such level 2 material includes the 
trident, Gerudo, Zuna, the Pyramid, the Royal Jewels, the Knights of Hyrule, and
some of what Kaepora Gaebora says.

LEVEL 1: Low-Level Canon
All quotes marked with (TMLN 1) are probably inconsequential to the construction
of the timeline, and might be called Easter Eggs.  I sometimes labeled seemingly
irrelevant quotes a 1, because someone could very well end up using them to 
support random point in some time line discussion or another.  Important 
characters like Zelda and the maidens will always at least be given a 1 rating, 
even if what they're saying doesn't appear to be relevant to the time line.  
These types of quotes can still be utilized for deciphering the personality of 
important characters.

The Story of Hyrulean Adventure

Long ago in the inner reaches of Hyrule, an evil wind sorcerer known as 
Vaati began kidnapping beautiful young maidens, one after another.

Nobody could stop Vaati, and the people of Hyrule despaired. Then, a brave 
young warrior carrying only a single sword appeared.

When the young lad took out his sword, he split into four separate
beings. The legends say that these four beings worked as one 
and defeated Vaati.

The wanderer, united once again, imprisoned 
Vaati deep in Hyrule and sealed the
prison with his own sword. This place
became known as the Realm of the
Four Sword.

After that, a long time passed.

Then, the wind sorcerer Vaati broke out of his prison and then snatched
Princess Zelda of Hyrule.  

Zelda's childhood friend, a young boy named Link, claimed the strange
power of the Four Sword and fought Vaati fiercely. In the end, he succeeded
in sealing Vaati away once again.  

And so, peace was restored to Hyrule once again.

Or so everyone thought...

Game Prologue(TMLN 3)~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~(0.9)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~


Long ago, in the kingdom of
Hyrule, a wind sorcerer
named Vaati appeared.

Vaati terrorized the people 
of Hyrule and kidnapped 
many beautiful girls from 
their homes.

When all hope seemed lost,
a young boy carrying 
little more than a 
sword appeared.

According to the legends,
when the boy drew his sword,
he split into four, the
four-who-are-one worked
together to vanquish Vaati.

The hero used his word to 
bind Vaati in a remote area 
in Hyrule.  The people 
christened the blade the Four
Sword and built a shrine 
around it.  There it remained
undisturbed for years.

Ages flowed by...

The wind sorcerer Vaati
broke free of his prison 
and kidnapped Zelda, the
princess of Hyrule.

Princess Zelda's childhood
friend, Link, used the power 
of the Four Sword to defeat
Vaati and seal him away
once again.

And, for a time, the people 
of Hyrule believed that 
their land was safe.

Until...

_______________________________________________________________________________


VOICE FROM THE LIGHT(TMLN 1)
Link... Link... 
Can you hear my voice?


NARRATOR(TMLN 1)
Swiftly and suddenly, dark
clouds covered all of Hyrule.

Ominous clouds that filled 
all those who saw them
with fear...

A sense of dread swept
across the land.


VOICE FROM THE LIGHT
Link...
Hurry to Hyrule Castle...


~Hyrule Castle~

PRINCESS ZELDA(TMLN 1)
Oh, Link...
It's you!  Thank goodness
you came!

The six maidens who guard 
Hyrule are gathered here in
the castle.

The sky has become so dark
and foreboding...

I'm worried about the seal
that binds the wind
sorcerer Vaati.


VOICE
Princess Zelda!
Come quickly!


PRINCESS ZELDA(TMLN 1)
We must hurry.
Come, this way.


~Maidens Sanctuary~

PRINCESS ZELDA(TMLN 2)
These six maidens guard the
portal to the Four Sword 
Sanctuary to keep it safe.

I'm going now to make sure 
Vaati's seal remains strong.

Now, the shrine maidens and 
I must open the portal to the 
Four Sword's resting place.

Step back, Link...
[Maidens create the portal]

Come with me, Link.
[Gasp, Shadow Link appears]

Ah!

Wh...who are--?

It can't be...
You're...Link?!

[Shadow Link encapsulates the maidens, disappearing into the portal; Link 
follows him through the portal, to the Four Sword Sanctuary.]


~Four Sword Sanctuary~

[Shadow Link taunts Link into approaching the Four Sword]

NARRATOR(TMLN 2)
This sword guards the seal 
on the wind sorcerer Vaati.

If you draw the sword, you 
must know what will happen.

Will you still draw forth 
the sword?

(No)

[Shadow Link continues to taunt Link, until he approaches it again]

So you accept the fate of the 
one who draws this sword?

(Yes)

[Link pulls it out, splitting into four.  Shadow Link laughs and runs away, but 
as Link tries to pursue him, dark magic spews from the pedestal, and a windy 
cyclone appears, carrying the four Links away.  The sorcerer Vaati appears from 
the pedestal, (in his beastly eyeball form) and cackles.  The screen fades.]

[black screen; flapping wings and owl coos can be heard every once in awhile]

VOICE(TMLN 2)
Link...
You have accepted the
destiny of the hero...

Princess Zelda and the six 
maidens have been taken 
by dark forces.

However, Vaati's magic has
robbed the Four Sword of its 
power to vanquish darkness.

To return the sword to its 
full strength, find the source 
of that power: Force Gems.

Gather Force Gems wherever
they lie, and rescue the 
maidens and Princess Zelda.

STAGE 1: Lake Hylia~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~(1.1)

[black screen except for four Links passed out on the ground]

VOICE
Link! Link!
You must awaken, Link!

[screen opens to green field, an Owl flies in landing on a perch.]

Hoo hoot!
At last, you're awake, Link.

I am Kaepora Gaebora.

KAEPORA GAEBORA(TMLN 2)
Mine is the voice you've 
been hearing since you left 
the Four Sword Sanctuary. 

I know you're worried about 
finding Vaati, but you must 
not act rashly.

Find the six shrine maidens 
and Princess Zelda, and you 
will also find Vaati.

As for that dark shadow...
Let's call him Shadow Link.
That one is up to no good.

Your sword is weak, but you 
can restore its power by 
infusing it with Force Gems.

Hoo hoo! First, gather the 
four who were once one with 
the L Button or Y button.

I must fly, but we will meet 
again on the road ahead.

[Kaepora Gaebora flies away]

OLD MAN IN HOUSE
Hm?
I've never seen you lads in
these parts before.

I'm spending my retirement
teaching my grandkids all
about formations.

You may not believe me, but
I'm a former castle guard!
A professional adventurer.

Formations are the key to
working together and
performing great deeds!

If you're interested in
learning more about it,
go on into my backyard!

[Move into backyard]

OK. We'll get started once
you're all standing in
the field on the left!

GRANDKID 1
If you get into formation
and unite your strength,
you can do almost anything!

You can certainly do more
than any one of you could
do alone.

GRANDKID 2
Oh! Hi there. You know, if
you have a Game Boy
Advance, you should use it.

We always connect our
Game Boy Advance systems!

It's nice to have a little
privacy when you go into
a house or a cave.

That's what our grandfather
always says. But...what
would he need privacy for?

GRANDKID 3
Press the L Button or the 
Y Button to change 
formations!

GRANDKID 4
Oh, hello there!

Did you come to learn
formations from my
grandfather, too?

If so, you can do your
training over there!

GRANDFATHER (instructing)
OK! Looks like you're ready
to get started!

I'm going to drill you boys
in the art of formations!

And... Wait, hold it!
I guess I'd better explain
how this all works first!

Um... I'll yell out the name
of a formation!

You will press the L Button
or the Y Button to form up!

That's it!!

If you hear a formation
name but don't know which
it is, watch my grandkids.

All right then...
Here we go!

[do the four formations: Box, Wide, Long, Cross]

That's enough!

That's the end of the drill!

I'll give you some Force
Gems for all the hard work
you've done!

No matter where you go or
what you do, remember
your formations!

Your safety is my number-
one concern!

[move into house again]

GRANDFATHER
Listen up! Formations are
the foundation upon which
adventurers are made.

Good formations mean good
cooperation, and teamwork
is the key to adventure!

SIGN
The bridge is out!

If you just have to see
what's on the other side,
press and hold the B Button!

SIGN 
Do not recklessly pick up
stones and throw them by
pressing the R Button!

OLD WOMAN IN HOUSE
Oh, thank goodness!

That stupid door was really
getting on my nerves!

It never occurred to me that
someone might have locked
it from the outside!

I'm convinced it was that
shadow boy, the one who
looks just like you.

Strange things are happening
everywhere these days. You
boys watch yourselves.

OLD WOMAN IN HOUSE (again)
I don't know...
You look JUST LIKE that
shadow guy.

But you eyes! They sparkle
and shine with light!

I can tell just by looking
into your eyes that you're
not bad boys.

MAN IN BACKYARD
I've started working out so
I can do something about all
those Octoroks out front.

Still, no matter how strong
I am, I'll never be able to,
say, lift a huge rock alone!

MAN IN BACKYARD (again)
If I have someone to help
lift it, I'm sure it would
be as easy as pie.

OLD WOMAN IN HOUSE (on way out)
Oh, so you want that rod,
do you?

That shadow boy was
after the same thing.

I hid it from him, but I
think you can have it.
You've been so nice to me.

And besides, you look like
you can be trusted with it.

Take care of it,
all right?

[As you lift a large rock, a strange person appears]
... ... ...

... ... ...

Huh?!
You... You've saved Tingle!

TINGLE(TMLN 1)
... ... ...

Ooo...!
Th-that outfit! That aura!

It's the fairy that Tingle
has dreamed of...

It's you!!

Oh, Mr. Fairy! You coming to
my rescue has left me
overcome with emotion!

Let me thank you by sharing
some thrilling Tingle news
with you!

The oh so Tingle-esque
pastime of collecting Force
Gems is all the rage now!

In fact, I got stuck under
here trying to get the Force
Gem under this rock.

But you saved me! Clearly,
it was the power of the gems
that led you here to me!

Tingle believes without a
doubt the good things come
from collecting Force Gems!

Why, collecting enough Force
Gems may even turn Tingle
into a real and true fairy!

No doubt that's why you're
after the Force Gems, too,
isn't it, Mr. Fairy?

Let's be fair about where
we look and share the gems
equally, Mr. Fairy!

And with that, Tingle must
say his farwells!

...

...Don't follow me!

Tingle

Tingle

Kooloo-

limpah!

SIGN
-Swimming Basics-
Don't be timid! Jump on in!

Press the A Button to swim!
Press the B Button to dive!
Don't stay under too long!

THEIF IN CAVE
Shooting folks out of my
homemade cannon's my
hobby!

Hey! You wanna go for a
ride? Well, climb on in
and press the A Button.

You shoot right up like a
human cannonball!

If you wanna leave,
press ? or ? at one
of the exits!

THEIF IN A CAVE
Whoa!
Look at you...
You guys're identical!

Say... The four of
you...You're brothers?
Or...friends, is that it?

OK, listen up. I'm real
particular about friends.

Friends don't always have
to be doing the same
thing, you know?

True friends can do
their own thing and still work
things out together.

Just press the X Button
 or the + Control Pad
to check up on your friends.

And when you want to be
with your friends again,
press the L or Y Button!

Sounds nice, doesn't it?
I've got to get some
friends of my own.

KAEPORA GAEBORA(TMLN 2)
Link, those black spheres
form a barrier of darkness!

The darkness that Vaati
created is syphoning
the power from the land.

If these barriers are left
intact across Hyrule, Vaati
will grow even stronger.

Look! Already, the green
fields that once grew here
have withered to dust.

It is unforgivable, what
he has done to the land!

The power of the Four Sword
can destroy the barriers!

Link, you must bring
your light and pierce
the darkness!

KAEPORA GAEBORA (again)
You must combine the
strength of four into one
and fight your way out!



STAGE 2: Cave of No Return~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~(1.2)


GHOSTLY SPIRIT
Urrk urrrk...
You...have friends...
I'm jealous...

If you have friends, you can
toss 'em across charms...

I never had any friends.
You're a lucky guy...
Urrk urrrk...

MAGE 1
Ho ho ho...
So, back again, are you?

I've a feeling I'll be
seeing a lot of you...
Hee hee hee...

MAGE 2
So, we meet again!
Hee hee!

GHOSTLY SPIRIT
OoooOOooo...
SO you've wandered into this
cave of no return, too, eh?

If you want to escape alive,
you must pull a long lever.

Grab it with the R Button
then line up this way ?
and pull.

That's just common sense.

I was all alone, though,
so I couldn't do it...
I died all alone...

GHOSTLY SPIRIT (again)
If you see my children back home, be sure to
say hello... OoooOOoo...

GHOSTLY SPIRIT
OooOOooooOoo...
Someone...who looked just
like you...did this to me.

If you're looking to defeat
him check his tunic...

You can't hit him if you're
not wearing the same color.
It's common sense...

I'd guess as much from
the start, but he still
got the best of me...

GHOSTLY SPIRIT (again)
Say hi to my grandkids
back home...
OoooOOOOoooo...

[Defeat Shadow Link!]


STAGE 3: Hyrule Castle~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~(1.3)


SIGN
-Tingle Times-
                     Volume 1

Tingle had an encounter with
a charming lady fairy! It
was fate! Destiny!

I was sneaking along behind
her when she went into a
castle...and never came out!

Surely she's been captured,
because she's too adorable
for her own good!

If you happen to see
Miss Fairy, gaze upon
her lovingly for me.

Oh...and save her, too!
                        Tingle 

[As Link approaches the entrance, Kaepora Gaebora flies onto a nearby perch]

KAEPORA GAEBORA(TMLN 1)
Link! There's a terrible
fiend in Hyrule Castle.

He's leeching power from the
maidens little by little.

Listen well, Link.

To rescue the maidens, you
must face the fiercest of
foes.

Keep your wits about you,
and be wary!

[With that, Kaepora Gaebora flies away]

UGLY CREATURE 1
Who... Who is it?
Who's there?

You... You're not with those
fiends who have taken over
the castle, are you?

Please, would you help me?

I heard the maidens' cries
and came running to find the
castle a nest of fiends.

They captured me and split
me in two. That's why I look
so horrible right now!

Please, I beg of you.
Reunite my two halves!
Make me whole again!

UGLY CREATURE 2
Oh, happy day! Thank you!

Now, at last, we can merge
as one, and I can return
to my true form!

Please take me to the
barrier that blocked
your way.

I'll do my best to aid you
on your journey!

[When you approach the barrier, the two ugly creatures join into one beautiful 
creature]

I didn't think I would ever be
allowed to reclaim my true
form as a Great Fairy again!

GREAT FAIRY(TMLN 1)
Thank you so much,
brave ones!

[A hoard of soldiers enter]

Uh-oh!

It looks like those soldiers
have noticed us.

I'll take care of this!

[The Great Fairy twirls around and the casts a spell that eradicates all the
soldiers]

So this is the magical
barrier that barred
your way?

Allow me to take care
of this.

[The barrier is dispelled]

I'll let all of my friends
throughout Hyrule know...

"If you run into four
travelers with one face,

tend to their weariness
and ease the burden of
their travels!"

There is a tradition that
young, noble gentlemen
rescue damsels in distress.

And so, I leave the
well-being of the maidens
in your hands.

Take care!

[She disappears from sight]

BLUE MAIDEN(TMLN 2)
Where am I?

The darkness...It's gone.
I have been freed,
haven't I?

Link! What's happened
to you?

Oh, the Four Sword. You've
drawn the mystic blade.

That means Vaati is free
once more, does it not?

And you've taken up the
mantle fate has given you.
How brave!

Such determination speaks
well of you. You are truly
a great hero. Oh...

Oh! There's something you
must know! The dark
shadow that captured us...

It looked...just like you!
What was it?

Link... You must save
the princess and the
remaining maidens!

Travel by sea under my
protection to a place called
the Eastern Temple.

Another of my kidnapped
sisters is imprisoned
there.

Allow me to transform, that
I might serve as your guide.
Come! We must go!

LARGE WOMAN
Hmph! If I can't get through

I should let anyone else!

HUSBAND OF LARGE WOMAN
Don't pay any attention

She can be pretty stubborn.
Once she makes up her mind,
there's no changing it.

Why don't you go around

(if you have no weapon or it's already upgraded)

All I can do is ease your wariness.

MAGE
What's he trying to prove?
Tossing giant bombs around
like that is dangerous.

I didn't even know they
made bombs that big! Those
just can't be good.

If you value your life,
you'd better flee when
you see one of those things.

Oh, and one more thing:
you and that mad bomber
are like two peas in a pod.

You're practically identical
twins! What's up with that?
HEHEHEHEHEHEHE!


STAGE 2: Village of the Blue Maiden~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~(2.2)


SIGN
-Tingle Times-
                     Volume 2

Strange days have arrived
in the village as one child
after another disappears.

Tingle bets that they're all
ditching school, no doubt
playing some charming game.

Oooh!
Tingle wants to play, too!

If you discover the kids'
whereabouts, play awhile
for Tingle's sake!

Search 'til your eyes
are bloodshot and weary!
                        Tingle

OLD MAN IN FRONT OF VILLAGE(TMLN 1)
Oh! Travelers! Listen!
Calamity has befallen
our town!

First whirlwinds,
and the mages!

What are we to do?

We need one who can
sense the Moon Gates...

So if you run across anyone
who can do that, well... Be
sure to let me know, OK?

KAEPORA GAEBORA(TMLN 2)
Hoot hoo!
Link, are you now able to
wield the Four Sword?

It's a sacred sword able to
smite the darkness.
And that's not all.

It also grants you the power
to see the shadowy Dark
World.

The people of this village...
They're being spirited away
by some force.

It may be that the Dark
World is drawing them in.

Save the villagers, Link!
Bring light to their darkness!

OLD MAN IN FRONT OF VILLAGE (after Kaepora Gaebora)
...

Incredible! You can sense
the Moon Gates?

...Then perhaps you can
save our village!

Then take this Moon Pearl!

MAGE(TMLN 2)
This world is like
a dark mirror
of you own...

It looks familiar, but in
truth it is very different.
Much like you four...

Eee hee hee hee hee!

VILLAGE LADY (next to Moon Gate)
Huh?!? Where'd you come
from!? I'm not used to kids
appearing out of nowhere!

No, kids around here usually
just vanish! The whole town
is in an uproar about it.

Guys from the Seeker's Guild
are looking into it in the
northwest part of town.

VILLAGE LADY (again)
There's always a huge line
at the Seeker's Guild in
the northwest part of town.

You look awful young. You'd
better be careful. I don't
want you to disappear, too!

SIGN
-Force Tree-

This tree gives fruit
to tremendous Force, or
so it is said.

Unify your body and spirit
and strike the tree.
You might be rewarded!

LARGE LADY
How come the shop next
door is getting all that
business?

I just remodeled my place
and everything! People
should be flocking here!

I'm trying to get people
excited, so I'm standing
in line for my own store!

And I'm not budging!

LARGE LADY (after moved)
What do you want?!
I'm in line here! What do
you think you're doing?!

You're probably spying for
that shop next door, aren't
you! Well, beat it! Scram!

SHOP BYSTANDER 1
I want to go into that shop,
but I can't get by...

SHOP BYSTANDER 1 (after Large Lady moved)
I'm glad I can finally get
into the shop, but...I'm
not sure I want to go in.

Mostly, I'm just afraid that
woman will block the door
again, and I'll be trapped!

SHOP BYSTANDER 2
Would someone do something
about that woman? She's
blocking the door!

I tried asking, but she just
won't budge. I guess I
could try shoving her...

She looks kinda...heavy,
though. I doubt anyone
could do it alone.

SHOP BYSTANDER 2 (after Large Lady moved)
Hey! You got that woman
out of the way. Thanks!

1st BYSTANDER IN GUILD LINE (starting at front)
Whoa there! No cutting in!

If you want people to treat
you like an adult, you'd
better learn some manners!!

To the back of the line
with you!

2nd BYSTANDER IN GUILD LINE
Sheesh! How long am I going
to have to wait here?!?

3rd BYSTANDER IN GUILD LINE
My only daughter has
vanished! Someone has
to look for her! Now!!!

4th BYSTANDER IN GUILD LINE
My husband and I came here
to request an inquiry.

I wonder if such a small
guild from such a small town
can handle such a big task.

5th BYSTANDER IN GUILD LINE
Huh? Who, me?

Oh, I'm sorry. I'm just
here looking around.

I just...saw a huge line
and figured it must be
for something good!

6th BYSTANDER IN GUILD LINE
Ohh... My poor, darling
grandson. Gone...

This whole experience has
been awful! I came to ask
the guild members for help.

7th BYSTANDER IN GUILD LINE
What's going on here! This
line isn't moving at all!

If this keeps up, I'm going
to make them investigate
my case for free!

7th BYSTANDER IN GUILD LINE
I'm going to ask the
Seeker's Guild to let
me join them.

If they made me a Secret
Agent I'd solve all these
people's problems pronto!

8th BYSTANDER IN GUILD LINE
Hey! No cutting!
	
What, you expect me to
believe you just want to
get to the other side?

Yeah, right! That's what
the Cucco said! Well,
you're not gonna fool me!

9th BYSTANDER IN GUILD LINE
Isn't that girl in front of
me cute? There's no way I'm
letting you block my view!

10th BYSTANDER IN GUILD LINE
Heavens! Such a cute little
boy! ...What are you doing
with such a big sword?

11th BYSTANDER IN GUILD LINE
When is it finally going to
be my turn? This is awful!

I don't care how long it
takes, but I'm not getting
out of this line!

12th BYSTANDER IN GUILD LINE
Uhh... Please! Someone make
this line move faster. I
really have to go!

...Huh? This isn't the line
for the bathroom?

13th BYSTANDER IN GUILD LINE
Ugh! It's just like my
dolt of a son to cause
me so much trouble!

14th BYSTANDER IN GUILD LINE
That lady in front of me is
scary. If I were a kid, I
might not want to come back home.

15th BYSTANDER IN GUILD LINE
I'm pretty, and I have a
pure heart, just like a
little kid.

I came out her to see if
maybe someone could
kidnap me!

16th BYSTANDER IN GUILD LINE
I feel like I've been
standing here forever. It's
tough on an old woman...

SEEKER'S GUILD LEADER(TMLN 1)
Hmph!
You spotted the entrance.
You have a keen eye.

This is the office of the
legendary Seeker's Guild.

We're investigating the
sudden appearance of those
suspicious mages.

We've reason to believe
they may be connected to
the vanishing children.

What do you say? You
seem talented enough.

Care to help us out?

(No)

Oh, really... Too bad.
We're shorthanded and in
a bit of a bind.

If you change your mind,
stop by anytime!

Oh, it's you!

So you've decided to help
us Seekers after all.

(Yes)

Oh, you'll help?!
That is spectacular!

There's something I need
you to do right away.

Four of out brothers are in
the village investigating
the weird mages.

They must have found some
clues by now.

Go and speak to the four
of them and see what clues
they've found so far.

The key to this mystery's
bound to be in those clues.

One of the brothers should
be right out here to the
left.

You have your orders!

Come on back when you've
gotten clues from all
four brothers!!

GIRL
We spend all of our time
here running and racing!

There are no adults, so we
play and play all day long!

If you can reach the goal
within 20 seconds, I'll give
you some amazing boots!

Give it a try?

(No)

What? Are you chicken?
These boots can make you a
racing expert, you know!

Let me know if you change
your mind!

So you want the boots after
all do you?

(Yes)

I thought so! Let me
explain how this works!

The rules are a breeze!
All you have to do is
reach the goal!

Go talk to my friend at
the end of the maze.

If you get there within
20 seconds of starting,
you win!

OK, here you go...
Ready...

GO!

GIRL'S FRIEND (if you don't make it)
GOAL!

Your time is...
___"!

Oh, too bad!
Try again later!

GIRL
I've got to get ready.
Come talk to me after a bit.

Came back to have another 
go at it, did you?

GIRL'S FRIEND (if you do make it)
GOAL!

Your time was
___"!

Congratulations!

The boots are over here.
Follow me!

Oh, and a little
advice for you...

You'll get back more quickly
if you break those cracked
blocks over there!

Use the boots to race
around to your heart's
delight!

GIRL(after boots)
You'd think that racing
would be more fun, but...
I don't know, I'm bored...

SEEKER 1
... ... ...

Hm...so you're a new
member of the Seeker's
Guild, are you?

Let me tell you about the
clues our investigation
has turned up so far.

This odd little mage
whispered this to me:

"The six..."

I'm sure it's connected to
this incident somehow!
Don't you forget it!

SEEKER 2
... ... ...

What was that?
You're...a brother of
the Seeker's Guild?

I see... Well then, listen
to the information I've
gathered.

An apprentice mage
disappeared somewhere
around here. POOF!

Right when she vanished,
she whispered something...

"Protect..."

Now that's suspicious!
You would do well to lock
that away in your head!

SEEKER 3
... ... ...

Oh, so you're here to help
with the investigation?
That's welcome news!

Well then, listen to what
I have to tell you!

Look! The mage is over
there, right?

I was hiding over here,
watching her, when I heard
her call out suddenly...

She said, "Beautiful!"

suspicious, isn't it? Maybe
it's part of a spell or
something!  What's she up to?

SEEKER 4
... ... ...

Oh, so now you're a member
of the Seeker's Guild?!

Well then, why don't you
listen to the clues I've
gathered so far!

A weird mage is lurking
somewhere back here....

I can sometimes hear her
talking to herself, and
this is what she says:

"Deeply connected to 
this village..."

That is most definitely a
clue! Go and report this
to the chief!

MAGE
You guys used a Moon Pearl,
didn't you?

...I sear! That guy there
has been staring at me for
quite a while now.

Who does that insolent
lout think he is?
That's just rude!

MAGE
Eee hee hee hee hee!

The girl here has vanished,
too.  No doubt she is
trembling in fear even now!

I don't know much about the
guild, but watching over us
is a waste of time!

But let them play cops
and robbers if they like!
Eee hee hee hee hee hee!

MAGE(TMLN 1)
You're the boy who awoke
Vaati, aren't you?

Thank you very much! You've
made the world a better
place for our kind!

You want a Moon Pearl?

I suppose it's the least I
can do after everything
you've done for me.

Well, good luck, kid!

Eee hee hee hee!

MAGE
You wanna see if you've got
connection to Force Gems
or not?

(No)

Then you're wastin' my time.
G'wan, get outta here!

(Yes)

I see.
Then let me spread some
Force Gems around outside.

I'll give you ten arrows.
You shoot 'em with your
bow.

Any Force Gems you hit
are yours to keep.

Ready... START!

It's done!
Eee hee!

So, 
did you feel a connection 
with the Force Gems?

THIEF
What's going on here?
This used to be one of the
best places to meet people.

I thought I'd just mingle
for a bit, but this joint's
as empty as my wallet!

Hm... But I don't really
want to go next door,
either.

That strange mage's been
over there reading that
book of hers forever. Weird!

MAN MISSING HIS HOUSE
My girl and I were fighting.
I took off, and when I came
back, my house was gone!

I went to her place, but all
I found was this strange
mage and a Seeker.
Where's my house?  Where's
my girlfriend!?!

Ah...I've lost everything...

What am I supposed to do
now?

IRIS
My name's Iris!
I'm a novice magician.

I lost my magic book, and 
now I don't have the magic
to get back home.

I tried some spells from
memory, and I got this tiny
house to appear...

But it's so frustrating!
Where in the world could my
book have gone?

SHOP KEEPER 
Hey! Let's gamble. You won't
get into and trouble!

Risk 100 Force Gems and see
if you can get more!

(No way)

Wow! Talk about a boring
guy! Maybe we can play
later?

(OK)

That's the spirit! OK, now
you can open whichever
treasure chest you want!

SEEKER'S GUILD LEADER
Oh, it's you. And you've
heard the clues gathered
by all our members.

... ... ...
Hm...yes...I see...
Those strange mages...

Yes, that does seem odd...

What do you believe the 
mages' words refer to?

(Maidens)

... ... ...

Of course...

Something's happened to
the six beautiful maidens
that protect the shrine...

That's it, isn't it?

Your powers of deduction
are truly magnificent!

We'll use your findings
to continue our
investigation!

Oh, yes... As thanks for
your help, I'd like to
give you something.

During the course of our
inquiry, we dug up a
hidden passageway.

Try digging by the
house of pots in the south-
eastern part of the village.

You should find a path
that will take you to places
otherwise unreachable.

SIGN
 Rest area ahead.

KID
Awesome! You found this
secret world, too?

Did you notice that there
are only kids here? All
we do is play and play!

No one wants to go home!
Not even me! No, sir!

Except...the girl in the
house with the red roof
is always crying.

I wonder if she doesn't like
it here.

KID (again)
It's so much fun here!
I wonder why that girl does
nothing but weep.

Don't even bother talking
to her.  She's no fun.

MAGE
I can see... I can see...
I can see all...

I can see Force Gems
hidden in the soil!

If you seek hidden Force
Gems, you must dig with 
a shovel of steel!

RED GIRL
Do you want to burn with my
flames of passion?

(No, Thanks)

Hmph! Fine. Whatever.

(Yes)

Goodness! Really? Then get
set to feel the
burning of my passion!

BLUE GIRL
Hmph! You probably like 
that girl more than you
like me, don't you!?!

WEEPING GIRL
Sniff...sniff...

My...boyfriend and I had a 
fight. It's my fault for
always being so stubborn.

It can't end over something
like this. Will I never see
him again? Sniff...sniff...

... ... ...

What's that?
You... You're going back
to your world?

... ... ..
Then please help me!
Take this letter to him!

NARRATOR
You took the letter!
Savior of romance!

MAN MISSING HIS HOUSE
... ... ...

What did you say? Is that
a letter from my sweetie?
Let me see it!

Hmm... uh-huh...
Oh...ah...

I'm so relieved.
My sweetie's OK!

But she was attacked by a
giant tornado and a dark
shadow that captured her.

Can she be rescued?
Hey, you! Do something,
please!

Sweetie gave me this feather
as a good-luck charm... You
can have it if you help her!

It's great! You'll feel like
a bird as you jump around
light as a...uh...feather.

You can even bound over
giant holes!

This is all I have left...
I want you to have it.

MAGE(TMLN 1)
That little brat, Iris!

I can't believe she's leave
such a valuable book just
lying around...

hey... Aren't you the
lads who freed Vaati?

What good timing. You know
how to get to the Dark
World, do you not?

If you see my apprentice,
a witch named Iris, please 
give her this book.

NARRATOR
You got a magic book!
It's full of dubious spells!

IRIS
...Say, what's that?
It's my book!!!

Well, I'll be!
Pretty impressive for
such a little fella.

... ... ...

Hm? The guy who owns this
house is upset? Oh! I didn't
think anyone owned it!

I thought I'd just magicked
it out of nowhere! I'd
better return it right away.

here, check this out! As
long as I have this book,
I can do anything!

I really must return this.

Abra this, hocus that,
shallabazoo!

Boo!

That should do it!

Look back in your world.
Then, you'll understand the
magnificence of my magic!

REUNITED COUPLE MAN
Oh! Thank you so very much!
I mean, this is all thanks
to you, isn't it?

My house suddenly appeared
out of nowhere, and when I
went inside, she was here!

Honestly, there are not
enough words in the world to
tell you how grateful I am!

I will never forget you, no
matter how long I live!

REUNITED COUPLE WOMAN
Thank you! I'm so happy
for all that you've done
for us!

Not only did I make it
back to this world, but
we also made up again!

I just hope the rest of
the villagers can get help
soon, too...

OLD WOMAN 
Because of everything that's
been happening in town, I
want to get away for a bit.

Maybe I'll go to the Eastern
Palace. It's nothing like
this old village.

I really need a vacation,
but it's always the first
step that's the hardest.

I mean, I can't really go
anywhere until the rain
stops, can I?

If you're thinking of going
to the palace, you'd better
be careful.

[Defeat Shadow Link!]

HAPPY VILLAGER 1 (starting from far end of screen)
You guys saved our village!

I guess my eyes weren't
that messed up after all!

HAPPY VILLAGER 2
Aaaaah... I'll never take
the fresh, outside air for
granted ever again!

HAPPY VILLAGER 3
I can't believe I'm hearing
this! Just when I thought
everything was normal again!

Oh! You're the one who saved
the kids, aren't you?
Thank you so much!

HAPPY VILLAGER 4
Thanks to you guys, me and
my boyfriend are getting
along great again!
	
And we've promised to be
nice to each other from
now on! Thank you so much!

HAPPY VILLAGER 5
Hey, it's you guys! It's me!
You know, Secret Agent One!

I just wanted to thank all
of you on behalf of my boss,
who's just too darned busy.

This whole time, we thought
it was the mages... But it
was just a misunderstanding
	
If it weren't for you guys,
we never would have cracked
this case. We owe you big!

We'd really like you guys to 	
stay here in the village
and join our guild.

But we understand you can't,
so we won't try to force you
to stay.

But good luck out there! I
know you'll pull through,
whatever you're doing!

HAPPY VILLAGER 6
I was able to return safely
thanks to you guys bringing
me my book!
	
Of course, my teacher gave
me quite an earful for
misplacing it...

HAPPY VILLAGER 7
Thanks to you, all of the
town's children have been
returned!

We're so happy! Thanks for
everything you've done!

HAPPY VILLAGER 8
Just playing all the time
leaves me feeling a little
empty inside.

I'm gonna do my chores and
study hard to make playing
much more enjoyable!


STAGE 3: Eastern Temple~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~(2.3)


GHOSTLY SPIRIT
Oooo... Do you ever feel
like you're about to get
pummeled into oblivion?

If you want to get through
alive, you need a Moon
Pearl. Everyone knows that.

I didn't know that. Not
until after I'd died...
In fact, that's why I died.

Tell my wife and son back
home that I miss them...
Hurrrrk...

[Defeat Shadow Link!]

YELLOW MAIDEN(TMLN 2)
Link!
Did you defeat that giant
stone eye-thing?

Thank you! By defeating
that beast, you rescued
me from my crystal prison!

Thank you, Link.
You have my gratitude!

The wind sorcerer Vaati has
regained his power. When he
last tried to conquer Hyrule,

he built a Palace of Winds
in the Realm of the Heavens.

So even now, he's
sure to be-- 

Link! You must first rescue
Princess Zelda. Act quickly!

I rule over Death Mountain.
High stop the peak, the
Tower of Flames stands tall.

Climb the mountain. One of
the maidens must be trapped
in the tower of raging lava.

Come, Link.
I shall guide you.

LEVEL THREE: Death Mountain~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~(3.0)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~


STAGE 1: Death Mountain Foothills~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~(3.1)


YELLOW MAIDEN (fairy form)
Link! We're in northern
Hyrule, at the base of
Death Mountain.

Head for the peak!

SIGN(TMLN 1)
Warning! If you see either
Green Link, Red Link, Blue Link, or Purple Link
report back at once!

OLD MAN(TMLN 1)
There's an area near the
one-eyed giants called
Hebra's Hill.

People say that those who 
enter that region wander
lost for all eternity.

If you simply meander about
with no goal in mind, you'll
never reach the summit.

You must press on, always
focused on your sole intent:
to reach the peak!

OLD MAN (again)
To reach Hebra's Hill,
press on straight ahead.

OLD MAN IN MOVING HOUSE
Oh ho ho ho!
At last, at last!
I've done it!

My lifelong dream...

A moving house!!!

It's made of a special
light, yet sturdy, wood!

And fire poses no threat
at all! It's absolutely,
completely fireproof!

Go on and try it! The four
of you, step outside and
push the house. It'll move!

There's one problem, though.
Fill the house with 
furniture and it becomes

too heavy to budge.

That's why I've had to leave
it entirely empty. It's a
bit stark, but I like it!

OLD MAN IN MOVING HOUSE (again)
Test it out! Move it around
this empty field! Shove it

to your heart's delight!

MAGE(TMLN 1)
Oh ho ho ho...
Such youth... Troubled
by the giants are you?

We magic users have
enchanted two types
of medallion.

These medallions instantly
alter the shape of an evil
presence or make it vanish.

One of these medallions
is in that treasure chest
there.

It's one that I enchanted
myself. You may use it if
you like.

SIGN
Hebra's Hill


STAGE 2: The Mountain Path~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~(3.2)


KAEPORA GAEBORA(TMLN 2)
Hoo hoo hoo! Link, there's a
colossal bird wearing a mask
living on Death Mountain!

The giant beast appeared
after Vaati stormed the
mountain.

The mountain's guardians of
old--a tribe of Gorons--are
troubled by the bird, too.

I implore you, go and help
the Gorons! They're counting
on you, Link!

GORON
Oh, this is bad! This is
very, very bad! Hey! You!
C'mon, give me a hand.

See that cave? There are
water jars in there. Throw
'em and put out the fire.

GORON KID
There's been this weird
bird up on top of Death
Mountain a lot lately.

It flies around the peak
day after day. It's huge!

And the mask it's wearing!
I've never seen anything 
so scary!

If you go ask my dad, I'm
sure he'd crack that mask
for you.

GORON KID IN CAVE
That pot's filled with a lot
of oil, so be careful!

If you accidentally break
it... KABOOM!

My dad says you're welcome
to use it if you need to
burn stuff.

GORON
... ... ...

What?
You made the new road?

That's so helpful!
Thank you!

That new road you built
has been a lifesaver! Or
at least, a time-saver...

I'm gonna take a quick
rest, and then I'm headed
for the summit.

GORON
Oh, not good! Someone built 
a house here while I was
gone. That was fast!

It's covering the hole I
buried my most precious
belonging in...

If there were just some way
to move that house aside...

THIEF
H-Hey! Did you see one of
those Gorons out front?

I don't know what he's
thinking, but he's been
shaking my house like crazy!

I planted stakes outside to
hold my house in place, but
that guy is stupid strong.

GORON (after house is moved)
Whoa! Oh, whoa! That
big ol' house just
moved!

Yeah, all those stakes
stuck around the house
were such a pain.

But now that they're gone
I can just push that house
around all I want!

KID GORON
I can't even believe
he's a Goron...
It's just shameful!

Fire doesn't bug us!

Listen, brother! Go give
that pitiful Goron a
solid thumping!

Knock some sense back
into his rocky head!!

GORON
Darn it! Where'd he go!
It's a disgrace! Since when
is a Goron afraid of fire!?

We've been looking for him
everywhere. I bet he buried
himself again.

What are we going to do?
He still has the key...

UPROOTED GORON 1-4
Yaaaawwwnnn...
I was sleeping so soundly...
Let me be, will you?

UPROOTED GORON 1-4 (again)
What is it?
Do you need something?

UPROOTED GORON 5
Hey! What was that for!?
I was trying to hide!!
You're a meanie!

UPROOTED GORON 6
You found me! Good work!
And I thought that was a
pretty good hiding spot!

[Defeat Shadow Link!]

KAEPORA GAEBORA(TMLN 1)
The giant bird is just up
ahead. It is quite fast, so
keep your eyes open.

We bird folk like to fly high
and gaze down on the land.
This area is especially nice.

We'll not let beautiful
Hyrule be taken by these
dark beings.

...Hm?

That's Hyrule Castle...
I believe you've driven off
its darkness already, but...

Something's not right.
I shall go and investigate!
You keep going!

Get rid of that bird and 
save the maiden from
the Tower of Flames!

We shall meet again!


STAGE 3: Tower of Flames~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~(3.3)


[Defeat Shadow Link!]

GORON
Oh, this isn't good. I
brought my bombs all this
way, and then I dropped 'em.

They went right into the lava,
too. And I thought I had a
good plan...

I was gonna use them on the 
monsters around here. You
should watch out for them.

I mean, if they can toast
me, they're sure to burn
you to a crisp.

Oh, hey! I can teach you an
IN-credible way of dealing
with those pesky things.

What do you say? Would
you like to hear it?

(No, Thanks)

...Huh? Are you sure? You
might regret it later.

Well, I won't hold it
against you. If you change 
your mind, just come see me.

All it will take is one good
toasting, and you'll learn 
your lesson the hard way.

GORON (again)
Hey, there, brother!

Want to hear my great plan
for slaying Dodongos?

(Sure) 

Great! I'll show you!
The problem is those things
have skin as hard as rock.

Even with my strength, it's 
a waste to hit them. I can't
even make a dent!

But then it came to me! They
may be tough on the outside
but weak on the INSIDE!

So right when they open
their mouths to breather
fire, gulp! And then...

BLAMMO! What a great idea!
...But then I dropped my
bombs in the lava!

Ugh! I can't believe it!

KAEPORA GAEBORA
Hoo hoot!
Link! Danger has struck
Hyrule Castle once again!

The darkness we thought 
vanquished has returned.

Perhaps some dark agent
remained hidden, waiting for
the right moment to strike.

Where there is great evil,
though there may also be
an imprisoned shrine maiden.

You must tell the maiden
of this tower! We cannot
abandon Hyrule Castle!

GREEN MAIDEN(TMLN 2)
You passed through the
flames to rescue me!

Such bravery. You're just
like the Knights of Hyrule!

You've heard of the Knights
of Hyrule, of course!

They're the pride of the
kingdom! They would lay
down their lives for honor!

In Hyrule, four sacred jewels
can open the path to the
Realm of the Heavens.

The safety of these jewels
has for ages been entrusted
to the Knights o Hyrule.

And yet, in these dark times,
the knights are nowhere
to be seen...

I cannot hide my fears.

... ... ...

Pardon? Master Kaepora
Gaebora, you say?

Is that so... Well then, we
must go to Hyrule Castle!

We must liberate the castle!

STAGE 1: The Fields~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~(4.1)


GREEN MAIDEN (fairy form)
Link! Hyrule Castle fights
an even greater darkness
than before!

GREEN MAIDEN (fairy form) (next screen)
Hm? What's that girl doing
out there all by herself?

Link, please, you must
speak with her!

If she stays out there
alone, she's bound to
be attacked!

MALON(TMLN 1)
Um, excuse me...
Were you just talking
to...a green fairy?

I saw it! There was a
beautiful fairy fluttering
around you!

Amazing! What Poppa told
me really is true!

He said that good boys and 
girls get to meet fairies!

Like today! I was coming
home after running errands
but...I couldn't get back.

I mean, it started raining,
and the castle guards were
moving all the cannons...

The cannons are really old,
and they're not meant to be
used... It was really weird.

Say, if you're all going on
ahead, take me with you!

You're friends with the
green fairy, so of course
it's OK, right?

(No)

But why?
I'm sure the green fairy
would take me!

And you're friends with 
the green fairy, so you
must be a good kid.

Please!
Take me home!

(Yes)

Oh, great! Thanks!

My name's Malon!
I'm from the Lon Lon Ranch
right up the road.

It's not very far...
Thanks, again!

MALON (later)
Poppa!

POPPA
Oh... Malon!
You're late!

The rain's coming down so
hard, I was beginning
to worry!

In fact, I'd gotten so
worried that I was about 
to go looking for you!

MALON(TMLN 1)
To tell the truth, Poppa,
these young boys rescued
me!

The soldiers in the castle
we behaving so oddly, and 
I couldn't get past them.

They were moving the old
cannons around...and they
even aimed their bows at me!

POPPA
What? Really? That IS
Strange. Something must
have gotten into them.

What could be going on?
I wonder if something's 
happened at Hyrule Castle.

Malon, I'm just glad that
you made it home safely. It
sounded like a close call!

My thanks to all of you for
saving my poor Malon!

I'd love to give you a
token of my gratitude!

Hmmm...let's see...

I've got it! If you're going
to continue your trip, you
should go on horseback!

This castle guards are sure
to be headed this way, and
there are more ahead, too. 

You'll be much safer riding
my swift horses, I'm sure!

Our farms right next door.
We've lots of carrots around,
so take some with you.

Those horses love carrots!
They'll come running if
you've got some handy.

Thank you once again!
I'll never forget what
you've done!

MALON (again)
Thanks to all of you, I made
it back home safely!

I hate to admit it, but at
first, I wasn't sure I could
really count on you guys.

But it turns out, you guys
are the best! You're real
heroes!

I think I finally understand
why you guys are friends
with the green fairy.

Thank you so much!

POPPA (again)
We're so scared that we do
nothing but sit at home and
stare at the walls.

Oh yeah, at the bottom of
the stairs in front of our
house, there's a storeroom.

It's full of stuff we never
use, so if you see anything
you need, just take it!

STONE TABLET
Carrots for horses!
Help yourself!

Take a carrot?

(No)

You don't need that now!

(Yes)

You got a carrot! Take it 
out of your crystal ball
when you need a horse.

THIEF IN HOUSE
Hey! I can't believe you're
out with all those monsters
around.

You know, if I just had a
weapon, I'd do something
about them...

But the problem is I can't
even get to the shed where
all our weapons are stored!

Ooo! I know!

Since you don't mind going
outside, can you slay all
the one-eyed monsters?

If you do, you can use
whatever you want from
the storage shed.

Will you slay the monsters?

(No Way)

What? Why not? Well, come 
tell me if you change 
your mind.

THIEF IN HOUSE (again)
Hey! It's you!

Will  you slay the monsters?

(Sure)

Really? Sweet! There are
lots of weapons and stuff in
the storage shed.

I'm sure you'll find a good
use for at least one of
them!

Take whatever you want.
Just get rid of all the
one-eyed monsters!

Here's the key to the
storage shed. Take it
with you!

THIEF (again)
I'm counting on you to get
rid of the monsters!

OLD MAN IN HOUSE
Hah...

I know what my son says
about the weapons in the
storage shed...

but they're no match for
the one-eyed monsters.

A greater weapon may lie
in the cave to the north,
where my ancestors rest.

But the earth there has
crumbled to bits, making it
impossible to get there.

OLD MAN IN HOUSE (again)
Hmm... There must be some
way to get in that cave...

STONE TABLET IN CAVE
Follow the Great Fairy of
the Fountain's counsel to
wake the secret power...

STONE TABLETS IN SECRET CAVE
... ... ... ...
(Looks like an old grave)

THIEF IN HOUSE (after slaying monsters)
...

What's that? You say you
destroyed all the one-eyed
monsters?

That's great! Thank you!

I really should reward 
you! Uh... Gee... What
can I give you...

...

Umm... You're headed to
Hyrule Castle?

...Oh! I know!

There's this giant tree
that's blocking the path
to the castle...

But I dug a huge passageway
so I could get into the
castle.

Once I was done with it, I
sealed it up, but you could
dig it open if you wanted.

Take this shovel in exchange
for your help. You can dig
holes with it!

There's a spot north of our
shed where there might
be an underground cave.

You should start digging
around there and try to
find it.

If you have a hard time
finding it, try going to the 
Great Fairy's Fountain.

The fairy there can make 
this a powerful shovel!

OLD MAN IN HOUSE (again)
Oh! You again?

What? You slew all the 
monsters?

Oh, thank you so much!
You can see my son for 
your reward.

Finally, it's safe to go
outside again. And it's
all thanks to you!

BLUE KNIGHT OF HYRULE(TMLN 2)
I am the Knight of Hyrule
charged with guarding
the blue royal jewel.

To my shame, I fell under
the sway of dark powers

and was transformed into
a base creature of magic.

The jewel was also cursed,
and it became a portal to
the Dark World.

I am sorry for the citizens
of Hyrule who suffered...
and for Princess Zelda!

I trust you are going to
the Realm of the Heavens
and the Palace of Winds.

However, you must first
gather the royal jewels

to reveal the path to
the Tower of Winds.

There are three other
guardian knights. I fear
they too have been changed.

Free them from their dark
curses and retrieve the 
jewels!

The light must return to
Hyrule! I entrust you with
the blue royal jewel.

And with it, I place in
your hands the hopes of 
all Hyrule!

NARRATOR
You got a blue jewel!
You have three more jewels
left to find!


STAGE 2: The Swamp~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~(4.2)


KAEPORA GAEBORA(TMLN 1)
Be cautious, Link.
A poison swamp lies ahead!

Vaati! I curse the name!
His actions have poisoned
the very land!

The creatures who lived here
have long since fled the
effects of his foul presence.

Now all that remains are
monsters and floating weeds
that lead travelers astray.

I believe you can vanquish
this foulness and return
Hyrule to its former beauty.

Link, my friend, take care
not to get lost and drown
in this poisonous swamp!

SIGN
-Tingle Times-

Tingle got stuck in icky
sludge! It was so...slimy!

Tingle must write this all
down so that the same thing
doesn't happen next time.

I will gracefully flit
from leaf to handy leaf,
jumping with such joy.

Almost like skipping from
Zora to Zora!
                        Tingle

GHOSTLY GIRL
I came here on a dare, but
all of my friends vanished,
and now I'm all alone.

A ghost told me that they'd
all gone home. How mean!

Oooh... I'm scared...

DAMPE(TMLN 2)
It's dangerous out.
You shouldn't be
wandering around.

This shadowy guy gas been
stirring up trouble lately.
Actually he looks like you!

My name's Dampe. I'm
supposed to be the caretaker
at this here graveyard.

Only I can't take care
of a single thing right
now. I'm helpless!!!

These creatures, they are so
pleased. They treat our
world like their new home.

Listen up, boys.

Legends speak of a mirror
in which a dark tribe was 
sealed away long ago.

I understand it's supposed
to be hidden now somewhere
in the Forest of Light.

The forest's been covered by
pitch-black clouds recently.
It's a Forest of Dark now.

Yep, no mistake about it...
Something bad's a-brewin'
there.

GHOSTLY SPIRIT
I came to visit my
departed wife's grave.

Then she showed up,
saying she came to
visit MY grave...

I wish someone would tell
me which one of us is the
ghost and which isn't!


STAGE 3: Infiltration of Hyrule Castle~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~(4.3)


WHITE MAIDEN(TMLN 2)
Link... Thank you. You carry
my hopes with you...as well
as all of Hyrule's.

Wait... Is that the blue
royal jewel you carry?
How did you come by it?

Is that so?
The Knights of Hyrule... So
even the jewels are now...

Link, all we can do is put
our faith in the light and
press on

overcoming each obstacle
that confronts us.

My forest has lost its light.
Darkness covers it like a
shroud.

Link, will you go to the
forest? Perhaps you will find
some clues there.

In the heart of the forest is
a temple. The Dark Mirror
can be found there.

Long ago, a dark tribe
invaded Hyrule.

They were defeated and
imprisoned within the mirror.

The tribe's mirror prison was
then secreted away and
hidden in the forest temple

to sever its connection to
this world.

That Dark Mirror must never
fall into the hands of those
with evil hearts.

Link! The mirror is a danger
in anyone's hands but yours.
No one else can be trusted.

Retrieve the Dark Mirror
from the palace, and keep it
until Princess Zelda is safe.

Please. You are the only one
we can depend on...

First, let us proceed to the 
forest.

WHITE MAIDEN(TMLN 1) (fairy form)
Link, this is the Forest
of Light.

Or rather, it once was. Now,
the darkness grows deep,
and the air stagnant.

I wonder if some clue might
reveal itself here.

It seems that many foul 
beasts are gathering here.

Perhaps you might be able
to learn something from
them.

DEKU SCRUB(TMLN 2)
Everything's going swell
lately! And we have Ganon,
King of Darkness, to thank!

Huh? Vaati?

What's that? No, Vaati's
old news. Ganon's the King
of Darkness! Forget Vaati!

DEKU SCRUB
Oopipi!
Are you lost?

Oopipipipipi!
Yeah! Yeah! You'll be
lost forever!!

[Link stumbles upon Deku Scrubs circled around some type of skull shrine]

DEKU SCRUB 1(TMLN 1) (starting at bottom, going clockwise)
Soon, Lord Ganon's power
will change all of Hyrule's
forests into Lost Woods!

Once that happens, we'll be
able to travel freely!

DEKU SCRUB 2
Gwee hee!

I locked up the shovel and
hid the key to keep
strangers from finding it!

And let's not forget
my impeccable work
guarding it personally!

There's no way anyone will
ever get their hands on the
shovel!

DEKU SCRUB 3(TMLN 1)
Make sure that all who
enter the forest remain
here! Lord Ganon's orders!

But we're trying to build an
underground road that will
let us go anywhere...

Anyway, we've hidden
every single shovel we
could find!

If there are no holes, no
one will ever find our road.
We're absolutely brilliant!

DEKU SCRUB 4
Ah... I love darkness.
It's so soothing, so
relaxing.

DEKU SCRUB 5
Digging holes in woods this
big is tough work when your
shovel's been taken away.

We move four times as fast
in Deku Scrub formation 
tough, so it'll be a breeze.

You know,  doubt anyone
else could come up with 
such a cunning plan!

DEKU SCRUB 6(TMLN 1)
Thanks to Ganon, we were
awakened from our slumber!

DEKU SCRUB 7
The Lost Woods is our
birthplace!

If you wander lost here for
too long, you too can
become a Deku Scrub!

DEKU SCRUB 8
Uh-oh! I forgot about the
hole I dug as a joke
the other day...

I'll need to sneak away
later, grab a shovel, and
look for it...

DEKU SCRUB 9
I captured the Great Fairy
so that if someone steals
my shovel...

he won't be able to
power it up!

DEKU SCRUB 10
Where the heck did Decci
go?! That slacker should try
helping out once in a while!

DEPPI THE DEKU SCRUB
We're busy getting rid of
things in the woods that
are bad for Deku Scrubs.

This is the dumping ground.
No one's allowed here except
for magical creatures!

DEPPI THE DEKU SCRUB (again)
If you want to help, you've 
got to ask Dekki!

Dekki's around somewhere.
He likes dark places, so
go find him yourself!

DEKKI THE DEKU SCRUB
Hm. You're not a Deku Scrub,
so why are you even here?

Do you wanna help us?

(No)

Pfeh! I'm busy here! I don't
have time for your nonsense!

G'wan, get outta here!

DEKKI THE DEKU SCRUB (again)
Boy, oh, boy! Took you long
enough! If you want to work,
all you have to do's say so!

Hey! What's going on? Hey!
Do you want some work?

(Yes)

Really? Is that so?
That's a big help!

I was in deep trouble, 'cuz
there weren't enough Deku
Scrubs!

Now, uh...were you the one
who's going to help?

I see... Just you, huh?
Jeez, I got 50 guys helping 
me, you know?!

I'm just saying you
should have a helper...
or two...or three.

Oh, whatever. C'mon, let's
just get started.

You ready? I'm gonna name
three items, and I want you
to remember each of 'em!

I ain't repeating myself!!

Then you go into the woods,
nab 'em, and bring 'em back.
And in order, you hear!?

[Dekki chooses three random items from the following: water jar, stone, grass, 
oil pot, sign, or bomb.]

1.	Water jar
2.	Stone
3.	Grass

So go take all those things
I told you about and get
'em to Deppi in that order!

You make any mistakes, and 
you're fired! now, get
movin'! Time's a-wastin'!

DEKKI THE DEKU SCRUB (again)
Cut out all the chatter
while you're on the job!
Show some control!

DEPPI THE DEKU SCRUB (after talking to Dekki)
Don't dawdle! Bring it here!

DEPPI THE DEKU SCRUB (with wrong item)
Grrrrrr! That's not what 
you were supposed to bring!
You're useless!

You're fired!!

DEPPI THE DEKU SCRUB (again)
You've been fired,
so scram! Now!

DEKKI THE DEKU SCRUB (after getting fired)
That's it! You're fired!
You want to get your job
back, show me you got guts!

DEKKI THE DEKU SCRUB (after leaving and coming back)
What? You again?
Aren't you the whelp
that just got fired?

You're back to give it a 
second shot, is that it?

[Dekki gives you another list of items]

DEPPI THE DEKU SCRUB (with first item on list)
OK! That's one down!
Now hurry up and bring
the next one!

DEPPI THE DEKU SCRUB (with second item on list)
All right, that's number
two! Just one more to go!

DEPPI THE DEKU SCRUB (with final item on list)
That's all of them! Your
job's finished! Now give
Dekki the good news!

DEPPI THE DEKU SCRUB (again)
There's nothing left for 
you to give me! Get going
and report to Dekki!

DEKKI THE DEKU SCRUB (after job's finished)
Nice work!
You're not as worthless as
you look, you know that?

That's it! Job's done!

You did well, so I'm gonna 
give you a special reward!

A Power Bracelet!

Put this on and you can
move even the heaviest 
things!

DEKKI THE DEKU SCRUB (again)
Hey there! How you doin'?

Help us make all woods Deku
Scrub-friendly environments!

DEPPI THE DEKU SCRUB (after talking to Dekki)
You've got promise. That's

KAEPORA GAEBORA(TMLN 2)
Do you know this village,

home to many kind people.

Now however, it's become a
rather dangerous place.

The darkness that cloaks
its people has cost many
of them their humanity.

It's madness. How much
stronger will this darkness
in Hyrule grow?

Hoo hoot? Dark Mirror?

Hoo... So the shrine maidens
have said they want you to
watch over it?

Link...
You've proven yourself to
be trustworthy and reliable.

There's no need for me to

LETTER ON TABLE
Dearest,

we've been married now
for 56 years, and you've 
always been so good to me.

After I'm gone, please don't
let yourself be too sad
for too long.

If you get lonely, get
yourself a cute Cucco
as a pet.

If you do, perhaps you'll
be able to forget some
of your sorrow.

Good-bye, old timer.
We'll meet again one day.

OLD MAN IN HOUSE (with Cucco)
... ... ... ... ...

Ah, what an adorable Cucco.
It warms my old heart.

After my wife passed on, I 
was prepared to spend the
rest of my days alone...

But now that I've seen that
Cucco... Would you...let 
me take care of it for you?

I'll give you this key, and 
you can even take as many
Force Gems as you like.

If I have that Cucco by
my side, I won't need 
anything else.

OLD MAN IN HOUSE (again)
Her last wish was that I
adopt myself a pet Cucco.
What a little cutie...

Ohh...there! I can see it!

in these parts. That's why I
dug a pit to trap 'em!

And it looks like I've
caught someone in it!

C'mon, youngsters! If you'll
dig, I'll point out where 
that pit is!

OLD MAN WITH SHOVEL (again)
There! Dig there!

OLD MAN WITH SHOVEL (after hole is found)
Look at that! Found a pit,
did you?

Probably nothin' in there
but a thief, I'm guessing.

OLD MAN WITH CAGE
I've built a fence around
the village to keep any
thieves from escaping!

If you want to leave the
village, you have to capture 
ten thieves first.

All you gotta do is lift the
rascals up with the R Button
and put 'em in the cage.

I'm countin' on you.

OLD MAN WITH CAGE (again) 
You still have __ thieves
left to capture.

I know their hideout's 
around here somewhere.

Use the R Button to lift 'em
up and put 'em in this cage.

Nab every last one of them
miscreants even the once
holed up in their lair.

TREASURE CHEST
Too bad! You got nothing!

OLD MAN WITH CAGE (after catching ten thieves)
Well, I'll be!
Did you really capture every
last one of the thieves?

What a relief that is. Now
that they're all gone, I can
take that fence down.

You can come and go as you
please from now on.

OLD MAN WITH CAGE (again)
Looks like peace and quiet
will return to our village.

No need for me to look out
my window for thieves
anymore. What a relief!

And we have you to thank
for all of this!

OLD MAN BY TORCHES
You've seen it, of course,
haven't you?

All the trouble we've been
having with fires around
the village?

What we need is a good 
downpour, but there's nary a 
drop of rain to be had.

I'd say a rain prayer, but
I can't very well use the
flame from our own fires.

Hmm... Gotta do something,
or the village is doomed.
What to do...

OLD MAN BY TORCHES (again)
What I really need is a good
flame to use as part of 
my rain prayer.

(after torches are lit)
Oh...rain!
Blessed. blessed rain...

But...this is a bit...too
much rain...

I don't know why, but this 
doesn't feel right.

ZORA
Oh, I'm so hungry... I want 
to chow down on those
fish, but I can't catch 'em!

If you can get 10 or more of
them in my mouth, I'll give 
you a reward!

Do you want to try?
Hm? Do you?

(No)

I'm famished...
Go away!

(Yes)

I'm really famished, so
you've got to  do it within a
minute! Ready... GO!

Hold it!

Oh, that was tasty!
Here's your reward.

I'm stuffed!

SICK KID(TMLN 1)
Cough cough...

Did... Did you put out
the fires?

I'm always getting sick, and 
when those thugs started the
fires...cough...

I had to stay locked away
in here for my health.

I'd like to give you
something for rescuing
our village.

There's a treasure buried
in a pit in my yard.

You'll get more out of it
than I ever will.

So...cough...I want you to
have it.

(again)
My most special treasure,
my bug net...
It got burned up...

It's so sad. I used to dream
about going to the forest
with it when I got better.

[Defeat Shadow Link!]

GREEN KNIGHT OF HYRULE(TMLN 2)
Bearer of the Four Sword.

I am the Knight of Hyrule
charged with guarding the 
green royal jewel.

The Four Sword was the seal
to Vaati's prison.

If you have it, that means
the seal has been broken.

Yet the one who enshrouded
me in darkness was not
Vaati! It was...

Ah! If the one who enchanted
me and turned the jewel

into a dark portal wanted
Vaati restored...

His goal must be to use
Vaati to remake Hyrule into
a land of darkness.

Listen to me, heroes. You
must never forget that Vaati
is not the only foe you face.

I will follow my brother
knight's lead and entrust to
you this green royal jewel.

Now go!
You and the Four Sword!


STAGE 3: Temple of Darkness~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~(5.3)


[Several Deku Scrubs stand near the entrance to the Temple of Darkness]

DEKU SCRUB 1 (starting from left)
We're here to make sure no
shady types get into the
temple!

You guys look like a bunch
of weaklings, though. If you 
go in, you'll get stomped.

Ah, but it's a free world...
You can go get stomped if
you want! Ha ha ha hah!

DEKU SCRUB 2
The inside of the temple is
a rough place. You'll get
torn up in no time!

You'd better be prepared!

DEKU SCRUB 3(TMLN 1)
Hey! Why have you come to
the Temple of Darkness? Are 
you here to see Lord Ganon?!

DEKU SCRUB 4
You'll learn how strong Lord
Ganon is soon enough!

DEKU SCRUB 5(TMLN 1)
Lord Ganon told us to keep 
watch for any travelers
moving in groups of four.

And there are four of you,
aren't there? Geh heh heh...

But Lord Ganon would never
be afraid of kids like you.
He must mean someone else.

DEKU SCRUB 6
Whew... I'm beat! I've come
all the way from the Lost
Woods to pay my respects.

DEKU SCRUB IN FOUNDATION(TMLN 1)
Grrr!
What a bunch of thugs!

Blowing up our foundation
with your stupid little
bombs!

That's right! This is the
foundation for the glorious
Lord Ganon's statue!

It's not done yet, so don't
go manhandling it, punks!

Just be careful, because if
there are holes to the north 
and south of it, it'll move!

DEKU SCRUB IN FOUNDATION (after move)
Gwaaaaaaa!!!

You... You moved our
precious foundation! You...
You dared to touch it!!

What do you think you're
doing? You're so mean!!
Wahhh!!!

DEKU SCRUB 1
We're planning a cool stone
monument to put up here!

The inscription's been
finalized and everything!

"1. Put four in a vertical 
line." That's what it'll 
say! Is that cool or what?!

DEKU SCRUB 2
We're planning a stylish
stone monument to put up
here!

The inscription's been
finalized and everything!

"2. Break oil pots."
Now is that or is that not
the very height of style?!

Seriously, am I right?

DEKU SCRUB 3
We're planning a grand
stone monument to put here!

The inscription's been
finalized and everything!

"3. On the left wall."
One of the best inscriptions
ever, am I right?!

DEKU SCRUB 4
We're planning a sweet
stone monument to put up
here!

The inscription's been
finalized and everything!

"4. Four push together
as one." That's super sweet,
right?

WHITE MAIDEN (fairy form) (TMLN 2)
Ah!
The Dark Mirror... Someone's 
stolen the Dark Mirror!

That mirror reveals the 
wickedness within a person
and brings it to life.

It's an item of terrible,
dark power. No good can
come from this.

Shadow Link!!

Could he be your evil
reflection, cast by the
Dark Mirror?

If that were the motive of
the mirror's thief...
This is disastrous!

If we don't get the mirror
back, Hyrule will be overrun
with evil Shadow Links.

The mirror... Who took it?
And where?

WHITE MAIDEN (fairy form)
The red shrine maiden's in
trouble! The Mirror! The Dark
Mirror!

RED MAIDEN(TMLN 1)
The white maiden? I'm
worried about the mirror,
too. Who could have stolen it?

And what of the other shrine
maidens? Has Princess Zelda
been rescued?

WHITE MAIDEN(TMLN 2) (fairy form)
The whereabouts of the 
purple maiden and the 
princess are still...

We still have no clear idea
of who stole the mirror.

However, there is something
that disturbs me.

When those...things...first
entered my woods, they
spoke of their dark lord.

"Ganon, Ganon," they
chanted. It was as though
they were...worshipping.

RED MAIDEN(TMLN 3)
Ganon... I've heard that
name before. No wait...
It was Ganondorf...

But, no... That man was of
the Gerudo tribe.

I can't imagine these
creatures worshipping 
some desert nomad.

There's a Gerudo village
in the desert.

I doubt there is any
connection, but it cannot
hurt to check the village.

Beyond the village lie
ruins and an ancient 
pyramid.

They are so old that no
living creature knows
very much about them.

All I can tell you is that
no on who sets foot in the
pyramid ever returns.

If one of the maidens is
there, I fear for her safety.

Link... Despite all of this,
we must go there.

Let us be on our way! To
the endless desert sands!

LEVEL SIX: The Desert of Doubt~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~(6.0)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~


STAGE 1: Desert of Doubt~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~(6.1)


RED MAIDEN (fairy form)
Take heed, Link.
The road you must take is
enveloped in a fierce wind.

But remember how far you've
traveled. You must proceed.
You must go forward.

You can meet any obstacle
that arises. I believe that.

A Gerudo village lies due 
north of here. Go and speak
with them.

GERUDO(TMLN 1) 
Welcome. It's been a long
time since we've seen any
travelers here.

This village is our home. We
are the dwellers in the
desert, the Gerudo tribe.

The village is in a bit of
an uproar contending with
a man who broke our laws.

We can't do much for you,
but make yourself at home.

GERUDO IN TENT(TMLN 2)
The pyramid is sacred
to our people.

To have a criminal such as 
him enter... His presence 
stains its holy ground.

GERUDO IN TENT(TMLN 3)
The Desert Temple was built
to keep people away from
the pyramid.

None who enter the pyramids
or the temple have ever 
returned. They are tombs.

Yet the man has gone there
by himself. All for the sake
of his own mad desire!

GERUDO IN TENT(TMLN 3)
Once every 100 years, a 
special child is born unto
my people.

That child is destined to 
be the mighty guardian of
the Gerudo and the desert.

But this child, its heart
grew twisted with every
passing year.

The child became a man
who hungered for power
at any price.

GERUDO IN TENT(TMLN 2)
Curse that Ganondorf!
He broke our laws and
left for the pyramid...

I don't know what he plans,
but I am worried...

GERUDO IN TENT(TMLN 1)
Within this desert, an
ancient temple slumbers
amid ruins.

A perpetual sandstorm blows
here, a barrier to hinder
those who seek to enter.

If you plunge headlong into
the sands, you'll wind up
right where you started.

GERUDO ELDER(TMLN 2)
Tell me travelers what
brings you to these
borderlands?

Hmm...

I see... You came on word
of the maidens, eh?

Yes, this Ganondorf you
speak of is a member of
the Gerudo.

But his intent is unknown to
me. He has flouted the law
and fled for the pyramid.

To reach the pyramid, one
must first pass the trial
of the Desert Temple.

The villain Ganondorf will
no doubt draw his last 
breath failing this trial.

We've blocked the road to 
the desert to keep other 
fools from coming.

But considering the crisis
in Hyrule, we've no reason 
to stop you brave lads.

Go to the entrance of the 
village and speak to the
guards at the gate.

GERUTO ELDER (again)
The world is in turmoil. The
desert and her storms have 
grown fierce.	

Please rescue the 
maidens...and our world.

GERUDO AT GATE(TMLN 1)
From here on, the sandstorms
are brutal. Kids like you
will never make it through!

GERUDO AT GATE (after talking to elder)
... ... ...

Eh? You've received
special permission?

Well, then...
I've no choice, do I?

Go ahead. Go on through.

Remember though, the storms
ahead are terrible.
Be careful out there.

GERUDO AT GATE (again)
The sandstorms grow more
fierce from here on.
Be careful.

STONE TABLET
The road to truth will open
only for those who oppose
the inconstant winds.

ZUNA MAN(TMLN 2)
Oh, visitors to this village
are truly rare, you know?

We of the Zuna tribe live in
this village.

We may not look it now.
but we are descended from
the wise pyramid builders!

ZUNA MAN IN TENT(TMLN 1)
The man who came from the
south a while back gave off
bad vibes.

I waved and everything, but
the jerk just ignored me!
Hmph!

ZUNA WOMAN IN TENT
I'll give you a sand rub for
100 Force Gems!

It's a special massage
that's good for the heart!

(No thanks.)

And I was going to give you
a sand massage, too...
Oh well! Next time!

(Sure.)

100 Force Gems exactly.
Here's your massage!

Rub rub...rub...
Squeeze here...
Squeeze there...

Rub...rub rub...
A bit more here...
A bit less there...

There you go!
All done!

Whew! That is fantastic!

ZUNA MAN IN TENT(TMLN 2)
Do you want to know the
secret of the pyramid?

When we're young, we're
told all the legends of
the pyramid!

There are many frightening
tales about the pyramid.

They say there's an evil
force... No, wait... They
say there's no evil force.

Wait...which one was it?
Evil force or no evil force?

ZUNA WOMAN IN TENT(TMLN 1)
I was wandering about and
came across this temple in
the desert.

Eh? Where was it?

Uhm...let's see... I had no
business there, so I forgot.

ZUNA MINI-GAMER
Will your Force Gems
multiply or dropify? Risk
100 Force Gems and see!

What do you say?

(Forget It)

Too bad...
Save up your Force Gems
and try again.

(I'll Risk It)

Excellent!
Then open the chest of 
your choice!

(if the multiply)

Talk about lucky!
150 Force Gems!

(if they dropify)

Wrong!
You get 1 Force Gem!

(if you break even)

100 Force Gems!
You broke even!

ZUNA UNDER DESERT
To go west from here, you
must take uniform steps and 
move slowly. or else!

RED KNIGHT OF HYRULE(TMLN 2)
I am the Knight of Hyrule
charged with guarding the
red royal jewel.

Hear now the doom of the 
knights. We were bested by
a foe with a mighty weapon.

He cast us into the Dark
World, were we and the 
jewels were lost in shadow.

The Tower of Winds
vanished, and I...

No, WE servants of the
crown were turned into
monsters!

The man that defeated us
is also the same man who
created that shadowy imp.

A man from the desert
wastes... He is not Vaati.

Your dark twin was sent by
him to trick you into
breaking Vaati's seal.

I wonder were the fiend
got the amazing power he
now wields.

It matters not! None of
this allows me to aid
Princess Zelda.

And yet I cannot go on...

Brave ones...I entrust the red
royal jewel to you.

You now possess three
of them.

Obtain the fourth, and
bring light back to the 
Realm of the Heavens!

Oh! This is SO frustrating!

The floor's filled with 
holes, and I can't go

I wish I could fly like a
Pegasus... If only I had
boots that could do that!

RED MAIDEN(TMLN 2) (fairy form)
Hm?
That writing on those
large rocks...

It's in an ancient tongue...
Let's see if I can read it.

... ... ...
Seek...you...the world?
Seek you...power?

Does your...soul...despise
peace and...thirst for...
more?

Does you soul...cry...
for...destruction and...
conquest?

We...grant you...power to
...ruin...the world. The 
power of...darkness.

Evil...spirit of
magic trident.

You are...the...
King of Darkness.

... ... ...

Evil spirit... Spirit of magic?
Trident? This indentation is
in the shape of a weapon.

Do you think the person who
took this trident was...
Ganondorf?!?

The King of Darkness is
not Vaati?

Does this mean this wicked
man is somewhere in Hyrule
plotting even now?

Link! The situation is even
more desperate than I
believed!

We must hurry!

PURPLE MAIDEN(TMLN 1)
Link!
You've come to my aid?

You came to this pyramid of
no return just to rescue me?

Oh, thank you, Link!

...Princess Zelda?

Is this true? So she's still
in the clutches of those
creatures?

My sisters, show
yourselves please.

[The six shrine maidens gather]

SHRINE MAIDENS(TMLN 1)
We'll work together to find 
Princess Zelda!

Let our six hearts be one...
Now let us call to her!

[Princess Zelda appears in a dark crystal]

PRINCESS ZELDA(TMLN 1)
... ... ...

... ...Ah!
Link?! Is that you?
And the shrine maidens!

You're all safe...
I'm so relieved.

Link, I'm in the Tower
of Winds.

This is no longer the
tranquil road to the
Realm of the Heavens.

Vaati's underlings have
turned it into a frozen
fortress.

Hurry, Link! Vaati's power
grows ever stronger,
even as we speak...

[An evil laugh is heard as the screen fades; the six maidens appear again]

SHRINE MAIDENS(TMLN 1)
Ah!

Princess Zelda!

The Tower of Winds!!

She is trapped in the Tower
of Wind, which has now
vanished from Hyrule...

Accursed Vaati! The
princess is in danger!

Link! Quickly, you must
get the last royal jewel
and bring back the tower!

You heroes have crossed 
Hyrule and gathered three
of the jewels.

There's only one place
left to search.

Frozen Hyrule, where the
power of darkness keeps
spring at bay...

The last royal jewel must
be there!

No matter the cost to us,
Princess Zelda must be
rescued!!

Hurry, Link!

SHRINE MAIDENS(TMLN 2) (fairy forms)
Link, the Tower of Winds has
vanished.

If we enshrine the royal
jewels on the Four Sword's 
sacred ground,

the temple may reappear.

We'll go on ahead and guard
the sacred ground from our
foe until you arrive.

The power of darkness has
halted the flow of time here,
and winter lingers on.

We must believe in tomorrow
and hold true to our hope.

May our passion keep our
hearts from freezing!

Link, you must first seek out
the final royal jewel!

Then, we will go to the
Tower of Winds, where
Princess Zelda awaits.

Thanks to you, we have been
freed from the dark spells
that bound us.

You must now take the four
royal jewels past this
ice-bound temple and

fly to sacred grounds!

Then you can enter the tower
leading to the Palace of
Winds, where Vaati lurks.

Deep within the palace
which soars above the Realm
of the Heavens,

a terrible darkness
awaits you all.

Yet if you do not dispel that
darkness, true peace will
never return to Hyrule.

The fate of Princess Zelda--
and all of Hyrule--rests

Come, let us proceed.

[The six shrine maidens are gathered around a pedestal]

SHRINE MAIDENS
Link...

You've returned to where
you started, the Four Sword
Sanctuary.

Now, give us the four
royal jewels...

[The four jewels rise from the colored Links and take their place in a pedestal
in each corner; they start glowing]

Hear me, heavens...
Hear me, earth...

Heed the light of the royal
jewels enshrined here, and
restore to us...

the Tower of Winds!!

[Light comes from the eye picture on the wall and a pillar of light restores

record of my mishap before
it happens to someone else.

...Why did I write
out "OooooOOoo"?

[A prism of light appears after defeating the boss]

PRINCESS ZELDA(TMLN 1)
Link?
It is you, isn't it, Link?

I believed you would come to
my rescue, and here you are.

I knew you would wield the
Four Sword and come...

Thanks to your efforts the
darkness above ground is
thinning.

The maidens and I will pray
to keep the darkness from
recovering its full strength.

However, the Realm of the
Heavens is now overflowing
with Vaati's monsters.

The darkness in the Realm of
the Heavens must be purged
if true peace is to return.

PRINCESS ZELDA(TMLN 1) (after bridge appears)
The time to face the wind
sorcerer Vaati is at hand.

There will be many traps
waiting for you in the
Palace of Winds.

Reaching the fiend will
be no small task.

Yet you, Link, are the only 
one who can save Hyrule.

The maidens and I and the
fortunate people whom you
have rescued...

those whom the darkness
claimed, the Knights of
Hyrule, and many others...

We all believe that you, Link,

You've defeated the

...!

[Pieces of the palace begin falling]

This palace was built
on the power of Vaati's
magical strength.

With its master gone, it can
no longer retain its form.

We can't stay here any
longer! We must escape
to the Tower of Winds!

[Inside palace, rubble is falling; a voice is heard]

GANON'S VOICE(TMLN 3)
This was all there was to
the wind sorcerer Vaati, eh?

Before the Four Sword, you
were at your wit's end.

Useless cur!

I did not steal enough power
from the Hyruleans.

My blood boils, heroes! It
seethes at the sight of you!

I thirst for destruction!
For the pure release of
rage, the power of wrath!

Four Sword or no, my
trident will reduce you
to nothingness!

I'm waiting, you worms!

[A blue shadowy cloud is seen leaving the palace]


~TOWER OF WINDS~

PRINCESS ZELDA
What's going on?
Why is the Tower of Winds
beginning to collapse?

Link!
We have to get out quickly!

[Zelda now guides Link toward the exit, stopping when there are enemies 
blocking her path, which Link must defeat]

PRINCESS ZELDA (later)
There are still monsters
about. If Vaati did not call
them, then...who did?

[Hoard of soldiers appear surrounding Links and Zelda; Link defeats them]

PRINCESS ZELDA (later)
What is this sense of dread
that fills the air?

PRINCESS ZELDA (later)
While we linger here, the
tower is crumbling about
us! We must hurry!

PRINCESS ZELDA (later)
The tower's collapsing...
I sense a tremendous
power approaching!

PRINCESS ZELDA (later)
The exit's not much 
farther!

[A soldier with a ball and chain appears, which Link must defeat]

PRINCESS ZELDA (later)
The exit's nearby!

Hu-Hurry!

[The floor beneath their feet crumbles and collapses; they all fall]

[After landing, the same shadowy cloud from the Palace of Winds appears before 
Zelda and Link]

PRINCESS ZELDA(TMLN 1)
What?! That raw patch of
darkness, deeper than the
blackest night...

Is... Is that Vaati?

No, it's not the wind
sorcerer...

No matter, I must use my
power to seal it away!

[Zelda attempts to use an orb of light to seal it away]

Can't breathe... My strength
is failing me...

The very air around me is
growing thin...dying...

I only need a bit...
more power...

GANON's VOICE(TMLN 1)
MORE!!

Enough!

The princess of Hyrule and
all her power amounts to
nothing!

Zelda! I, Ganon, now seal
you away forever!

[Zelda is taken captive; out of the shadowy cloud emerges a pig like beast 
wielding a trident...Ganon...duh]

GANON(TMLN 2)
Gwah haa haaaa!
Weaklings! Incompetent
fools!

You so-called heroes do
not stand even a gnat's 
chance of harming me!

Even if you worms attack
in a group,

I will skewer the lot of
you on my mighty trident!!

[Final Final Battle: Ganon; midway through the battle, Zelda breaks her bonds]

PRINCESS ZELDA(TMLN 2)
Ganon... This beast was once
of the Gerudo... Once human.
He was called Ganondorf!

King of Darkness, ancient
demon reborn. The wielder
of the trident!!

[Zelda makes another orb of light energy]

Yet now...
While Ganon's power has
waned...

I will pour all of my
remaining strength into
this ball of light!

While it is suffused with
power, I will release it
and strike!

At that time, use this!

[Link receives a bow]

Fire at the ball of light
with all your might!

If we combine our powers,
we may yet be able to seal
Ganon away from the world!

Link! You must hold back
Ganon until my ball of
light is ready!!

GANON(TMLN 2)(with glowing orange aura)
Do you think to stop me?
You have not even a fool's
chance of facing my power.

Once I am finished here, I
shall be rid of your Princess
Zelda forever!

[When you hit Ganon with the ball of light, he is suspended in the ball of 
light; the six shrine maidens appear and return to human form around him, 
casting a light spell]

PRINCESS ZELDA(TMLN 1)
Now! Hold the Four Sword
over your head!

GANON(TMLN 1)
Gyaaaaaaa! What... What
have you done? I am the
King of Darkness!

I cannot be destroyed by
insects like you! Noooo!!!

[The light grows more intense, then goes into the Four Sword. Ganon disappears 
with the light]

PRINCESS ZELDA(TMLN 3)
... ...

Link.

We whom you protected, and
all of Hyrule as well...

We will struggle together
and grow stronger than
before.

We will work as one, as the
four of you have done.
We will work...together.

Now, the Four Sword...

Place the sword that sealed
away the darkness on the
pedestal.

~FOUR SWORD SANCTUARY~

[The shrine maidens and Zelda surround the pedestal. Link comes forth; four 
swords rise up and merge into one, which is then lowers into the pedestal. The 
maidens create a triangular prism around the Four Sword, and then turn into 
fairies and leave. Link and Zelda then exit together]

Boss Descriptions~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~(9.2)

LEVEL 1

Phantom Ganon
Phantom Ganon hurls a ball of energy toward you and you must hit it 
back and forth until it strikes him. Once he is hit, he will fall on 
one knee and you must hit him with your sword several times to defeat 
him.

This boss has the same appearance as Wind Waker's Phantom Ganon.

LEVEL 2

Stone Arrghus
This giant eye encrusted with stone opens and closes. It is encompassed 
by several small stone eyes. Before you can harm the giant stone eye, 
you must use the boomerang to retrieve small stone eyes, and then kill 
them with your sword. Once the small stone eyes are all gone, the giant 
eye chases you on the floor. You must wait until it stops, and then hit 
it with your sword.

LEVEL 3

Dodongos
The Dodongos breathe fire. They're exterior is too tough to penetrate. 
The only way to hurt them is to throw a bomb in their mouths the moment 
they open. They will swallow the bomb and it will explode inside of 
them.
 
Same dodongos as in LoZ and OoS/A.

LEVEL 4

Big Poe
To defeat Big Poe, you must light the torches and anger him. He then 
sucks you up and you must battle the small creature inside of Big Poe. 

This appears to be the same Poe as in WW. It also follows the same two 
stages.

LEVEL 5

Phantom Ganon X 4
Phantom Ganon appears and splits into four. The three false Phantom 
Ganons throw silver balls of energy toward you, while the true Phantom 
Ganon throws colored balls of energy that correspond to who must hit it 
back. When the ball of energy hit Phantom Ganon, he becomes one again, 
and you hit him with the Four Sword.

LEVEL 6

Metal Moldorg
The key to defeating this giant Molgorg is its tail. The tail changes 
color every time it's damaged by the Link with the tunic that matches. 
After a while, the Molgorg splits into two Molgorgs, each following the 
same colored tail routine.

LEVEL 7

Frostare
A giant ice covered eye hangs from the ceiling. Several small ice eyes 
fly around the larger one. After defeating the small ice eyes using 
Roc's Feather to jump high enough to hit them with your sword, you can 
focus one the giant ice eye. You are unable to hit the eye with your 
sword, so you must step on the four switches hidden in one of the rooms 
to make more ledges appear. You then hop across and climb the ladder. 
In the top room, a dragon like thing blocks your path. If you strike it 
with your sword, you will notice that it hurts the giant ice eye. When 
the root is agitated enough, the ice eye begins to fly around. Hit the 
eye with your sword and it will fall to the ground. Attack the eye from 
above to defeat it.

LEVEL 8

Vaati
Vaati spins in a circle, creating a cyclone beneath him. Using the 
proper timing, throw bombs into the wind funnel to damage Vaati. Vaati 
then protects himself with purple orbs, forcing you to utilize a cannon 
to stab him from above with your sword. This alternates between the 
upper and lower levels. (TV screen and GBA screen)

Note: There is no dramatic climax when Vaati is defeated.

Ganon
Ganon twirls around his trident, which makes him invisible and impossible to 
hit. He then shoots rays of energy out of the tip of his trident. Try to hit 
him with your sword as often as possible. He sends you to the dark world, where 
you must defeat stafos to return to the light world and continue your battle. 
After a while, Ganon will warp Link and himself to a different spot in the 
room. After he stops spinning, he throws his trident around the room, with a 
blue blaze where it's traveled. After you hurt him enough, he begins to breath 
hard and Zelda comes down and is released from her bondage. Now Ganon has an 
orange glow/shadow. He spins his trident and then shoot green (or multi color 
for multi player) balls of energy out of the tip of his trident. If you hit 
enough back and hit him, he will collapse, breathing heavily. Zelda will 
release her ball of light, which will circle around him until you hit it with 
an arrow and hit him (or until he regains his strength).  When you hit him, he 
is held hostage within the light orb. He is then sealed within the Four Sword.

Notes~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~(9.3)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
I made some notes during my play-through of the game, keeping Twilight Princess
in mind.  Perhaps these notes will spur some cogs in intuitive theorists.  

-Ominous Clouds covered Hyrule
-Vaati's main followers are the magicians/mages
-Ganon's main followers are the Deku Scrubs, while the Gerudos shun him.
-The Knights of Hyrule were defeated by Ganon and his trident.
-There's no mention of a war or the Imprisoning War.
-The Dark Mirror sealed away a dark tribe, which sounds a lot like the Twilight
Mirror
-Kakariko Village taken over by thieves, in LttP, the Dark World is taken over
by thieves.
-Ganon has the same intentions as in LttP/TP ---> Land of Darkness
-Green Knight: REMAKE Hyrule into land of darkness? Probably meant "recreate"
-Dark Mirror stolen, slab of rock could be TP's slab only moved..
-Temple of Darkness<=>Temple of Light/Time (Lost Woods/Dark World)
-Gerudo only exist in OoT, and FSA
-Why is Ganondorf accepted by Gerudo in OoT, but not in FSA?
-Same pyramid as ALttP?
-Zuna's descendants build the Pyramid, and possibly the trident.
-Royal jewels look exactly the same as the Four Elements (TMC)
-Jewels function is to revel the Tower of Winds, while Elements function is to
power the Four Sword, but the Four Sword doesn't change at all when the Royal
Jewels are set, nor is there a said relationship between the jewels and the Four
Sword.  
-Vaati has no dialogue whatsoever, while he was quite the babble mouth in
FS/TMC, he might be nothing more than a pawn
-Vaati sort of "wisps" away once defeated.  No explosion or dramatic climax.
-Ganon the demon Reborn? No descriptive origins of trident, or the spirit of the
trident, could this be the spirit of Ganon sealed within the trident? 
-Link has a party at the castle in his honor
-Last scene of credits shows Zelda entering a room with a Triforce over the
doorway, which glows bright as the screen fades.  This is the only reference to
the Triforce in the game.

Anyone may email me to discuss the guide, point out errors, or discuss time line
theories.  I know there are errors, and I will do my best to edit and fix 
anything that's out of place.  I will always try to keep the guide up-to-date; 
changing ratings, notes, and adding content with each new Zelda released.  
Thanks for reading.
