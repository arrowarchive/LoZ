[02'01] ---        Kokiri Forest        --- [02'01] 



Deku Tree : In the vast, deep forest of Hyrule... Long have I served as the
guardian spirit... I am known as the Deku Tree...

* - A boy named "Link" is seen sleeping inside of a treehouse.

Deku Tree : The children of the forest, the Kokiri, live here with me.
Each Kokiri has his or her own guardian fairy. However, there is
one boy who does not have a fairy...

* - Link dreams of Hyrule Castle Town amid a rainstorm. The town's drawbridge
lowers, allowing a horse carrying a girl and a woman to leave. The girl
looks at Link, who stands outside of the town walls, as the horse gallops
out of sight.

Soon, a man emerges from the town atop a horse. He raises his left hand,
and directs the palm thereof toward Link.

The dream ends.

Deku Tree : Navi... Navi, where art thou? Come hither....

Oh, Navi the fairy... Listen to my words, the words of the Deku
Tree... Dost thou sense it? The climate of evil descending upon
this realm... Malevolent forces even now are mustering to attack
our land of Hyrule...

For so long, the Kokiri Forest, the source of life, has stood as
a barrier, deterring outsiders and maintaining the order of the
world... But...before this tremendous evil power, even my power is
as nothing.

It seems the time has come for the boy without a fairy to begin his
journey... The youth whose destiny it is to lead Hyrule to the path
of justice and truth...

Navi...go now! Find our young friend and guide him to me... I do not
have much time left. Fly, Navi, fly! The fate of the forest, nay,
the world, depends upon thee!

* - Navi leaves the Deku Tree, and looks about within the Kokiri's area of the
forest. After some difficulties, lastly flying into a fence, Navi arrives at
Link's treehouse and finds him sleeping.

Navi      : Hello, Link! Wake up! The Great Deku Tree wants to talk to you!
Link, get up!

Hey! C'mon! Can Hyrule's destiny really depend on such a lazy boy?

* - Link awakens.

Navi      : You finally woke up! I'm Navi the fairy! The Great Deku Tree asked
me to be your partner from now on! Nice to meet you!

The Great Deku Tree has summoned you! So let's get going, right now!

* - As Link exits the treehouse, a female Kokiri approaches.

Saria     : Yahoo! Hi, Link!

* - Link climbs down a ladder.

Saria     : Wow! A fairy!! Finally, a fairy came to you, Link! Wow! That's great
news! I'm so happy for you! Now you're a true Kokiri, Link!

Is that right? The Great Deku Tree has summoned you? It's quite an
honor to talk to the Great Deku Tree! I'll wait for you here.
Go see the Great Deku Tree!


Social Script  


[ Outside ]
[001]     : You're not allowed to leave the forest! The Great Deku Tree said
that if a Kokiri leaves the woods, he or she will die!

[002]     : Oh, a fairy finally came to you! Now you have a lot to learn!
The best place to go to learn some new skills is in the Forest
Training Center. It's on the hill just above here.

[003]     : {A} by the stone, pick it up! {A} by the stone, pick it up!
Mean old Mido...he made me pick up the rocks in front of his house.

[004]     : Hey, let's work on some moves!

To jump sideways while {Z} Targeting, press {A} as you move right
or left. To do a backflip while {Z} Targeting, press {A} as you move
backwards. To do a roll attack while {Z} Targeting, press {A} as you
move forward. While you roll, you can avoid damage. If you have your
sword ready while {Z} Targeting, you can do a jump attack by
pressing {A}! A jump attack does double damage!

You can use {Z} Targeting on the stone next to me, so let's
practice!

[005]     :{1} Oh, you have a fairy now?! That's great, Link!

What? You've been called by the Great Deku Tree? What an honor!
He may give you a special gift! Tee hee! That's because the Great
Deku Tree is our father, the forest guardian, and he gave life to
all of us Kokiri!

{2} I wonder if the Great Deku tree gave life to everything in the
forest, I mean in addition to us Kokiri?

[006]     : That meanie, Mido, made me cut the grass at Saria's house. Mido told
Saria he would do it so she would like him, but I'm the one doing
all the work! You and Saria are close friends, so will you help me
cut the grass? I'll let you keep anything that you find while
cutting it.

* - [007] is sitting on a platform above the shop.

[007]     : Hi, Link! Look this way! Look over here with {Z}, and talk to me
with {A}.

Yes, yes! That's how you use a fairy! It's so great that you finally
have a fairy partner!

I'll teach you how to talk to people using your fairy! When a fairy
flies near a person or thing, press {Z} to look in that direction.
If you use {Z} Targeting, you can talk to people from a distance,
like we're doing now. When you have nothing that you can target,
you can press {Z} just to look forward. Try it!

* - [008] is standing on a pillar, accessible only via two small suspension
bridges, one connected to a pillar and the other to Saria's house.

[008]     : Hee hee hee! You came all the way up here? You're a real man!

Look! Isn't this view pretty? Change your viewpoint with {C Up},
so you can look around the forest with {Control Stick}.

Sign 01   : Forest folk shall not leave these woods.

Sign 02   : House of the Great Mido
Boss of the Kokiri

Sign 03   : House of the Know-it-All Brothers

Sign 04   : Forest Training Center
Don't recklessly cut signs--read them carefully!

Sign 05   : Thrust Attack Signs!

To thrust with your sword, press {Control Stick} toward your target
while {Z} Targeting, then press {B}.

Sign 06   : Cut Grass With Your Sword

If you just swing with {B}, you'll cut horizontally. If you hold {Z}
as you swing, you'll cut vertically.

Sign 07   : Switch Targeting

If you see a {triangle} icon above an object, you can target it
with {Z}. In other words, if you press {Z} when you see [triangle]
above an object, you can lock on to it. If you press {Z} again,
the lock will either release or it will transfer to the next object
with the {triangle} above it.

When you have many enemies in your field of view and you want to
escape, press {Z} while holding back on {Control Stick} to cancel
targeting. You can target the stones next to this sign for practice!

Sign 08   : Hole of "Z"

Let's go through this small hole! Stand in front of the hole and
push {Control Stick} towards it. When the Action Icon shows "Enter,"
press {A} to crawl into the hole. Pay attention to what the Action
Icon says!

Sign 09   : View Point with {Z} Targeting

When you have no object to look at, you can just look forward with
{Z}. Stop moving and then change the direction you are facing,
or hold down {Z} for a little while. This can help you get oriented
in the direction you want to face. It's quite convenient!

If you hold down {Z}, you can walk sideways while facing straight
ahead. Walking sideways can be a very important technique in dungeon
corridors. Turn around and try doing this right now.

Sign 10   : Visit the House of the Know-it-All Brothers to get answers to all
your item-related questions!

Sign 11   : Link's House

Sign 12   : Stepping Stones in the Pond

If you boldly go in the direction you want to jump, you will leap
automatically. If you hop around on the stones, you'll become
happier!

* - A Blue Rupee is acquired upon successful crossing of the pond.

Sign 13   : Kokiri Shop
We have original forest goods!

Sign 14   : Saria's House

Sign 15   : House of Twins

Sign 16   : Just ahead: Great Deku Tree's Meadow

Sign 17   : The Lost Woods

[ Buildings ]
* - House of the Know-it-All Brothers:

[009]     : I can teach you about the icons at the top of the screen.

-----------------------------------------------
-(About the yellow icons)
The three yellow icons in the upper right are called {C} icons.
They display the things you can use with the {C Left}, {C Down}
and {C Right} buttons. Once you get a {C} Button Item, go into the
Select Item Subscreen and set it to one of the three {C} Buttons.

-(About the blue icon)
The blue icon at the top of the screen is called the Action Icon.
This Action Icon shows you what action you will perform when you
press {A}. Stop in many spots to see the different things you can
do.
-----------------------------------------------

[010]     : Do you want to know how to use the {C Up} Button?

-----------------------------------------------
-(Yes)
If you press {C Up}, you can change your view. In a place like this,
it will switch to a top-down view. Outdoors, in a field for example,
it will switch to a first-person perspective. Also, when "Navi" is
displayed in the upper right of your screen, Navi the fairy wants to
talk to you. Use {C Up} to listen to her!

-(No)
Well, if you play around with it, you'll figure it out.
-----------------------------------------------

[011]     : If you want to learn about the map and items, just ask me. But don't
ask unless you want to hear a long explanation. What do you want to
know about?

-----------------------------------------------
-(About the map)
There is a map displayed at the bottom right of the screen.
The yellow arrow shows your current position and direction you are
facing. The red mark shows where you entered the area from. You can
turn the map display on and off with the {L}.

If you want to see the name of a place, press START. You'll get into
the Subscreens. Select the Map Subscreen. On the Map Subscreen, you
can see a map of Hyrule. Did you get all that?

-(About items)
There are three kinds of items: Equipment items, {C} Button items
and Quest items.

Equipment items are things like the sword, shield and clothes that
are effective when you equip them. {C} Button items can be set to
{C Left}, {C Down}, and {C Right}, and used by pressing those
buttons. Quest items are things you collect during your adventure.
You just carry them around.

If you want to change equipment or just check on your inventory,
press STAR. You will get into the Subscreens. Switch to one of the
four different Subscreens with {Z} or {R} and change or check items
as you please. Take a look around! When you decide to equip an
Equipment item, press {A}. For {C} Button items, press {C Left},
{C Down} or {C Right}.

That was a pretty long explanation. Did you understand everything?

-(Don't ask)
Well, just remember this. If you want to save, press STAR to get
into the Subscreens, then press {B}.
-----------------------------------------------

* - House of Twins:

[012]     : My sister took some Rupees and went shopping at the store that has
a red roof. Tee hee! Speaking of Rupees, a green one is worth one,
a blue one is worth five and a red one is worth twenty. Hee hee!

-----
* - Kokiri Shop:

[013]     : This shop...It sells things you can get in the forest for free!
Tee hee!

Do you know how to use the Deku Shield? Tee hee! When you get the
shield, press START to get into the Subscreens. Select the Equipment
Subscreen with {Z} or {R}. On the Equipment Subscreen, choose the
item you want to equip and press {A} to equip that item. Once you
equip it, hold it up with {R} and change its angle with {Control
Stick}. Tee hee!

[014] ^   : We sell shields, but not swords!


Entering the meadow  


* - Mido is blocking the path to the Great Deku Tree's Meadow.

Mido      : Hey you! "Mr. No Fairy!" What's your business with the Great Deku
Tree? Without a fairy, you're not even a real man!

What?! You've got a fairy?! Say what? The Great Deku Tree actually
summoned you? Whaaaaaaat?! Why would he summon you and not the great
Mido? This isn't funny...

I don't believe it! You aren't even fully equipped yet! How do you
think you're going to help the Great Deku Tree without both a sword
and shield ready?

What? You're right. I don't have my equipment ready, but... If you
want you pass through here, you should at least equip a sword and
shield! Sheesh!

Saria     : What?! Mido won't let you go to see the Great Deku Tree? Ohh...
That bum! I don't know why he's always so mean to everyone!

What he said is true, though. The forest...strange things have been
happening here lately... You need to be ready for anything. You'd
better find a weapon! You can buy a shield at the shop, but there is
only one sword hidden somewhere in the forest.

* - Past the Hole of "Z", there is a chest containing the Kokiri Sword.
Upon returning to Mido with both the sword and the Deku Shield equipped:

Mido      : If you want you pass through here, you should at least equip a sword
and shield!

Eh, what's that?! Oh, you have a Deku Shield... And what's THAT?!
Is that the Kokiri Sword?! GOOD GRIEF!!

Well, even with all that stuff, a wimp is still a wimp, huh?
I, the great Mido, will never accept you as one of us!

Shoot! How did you get to be the favorite of Saria and the Great
Deku Tree? Huh?! Grumble...grumble...


Great Deku Tree's Meadow  


Navi      : Great Deku Tree... I'm back!

Deku Tree : Oh... Navi... Thou hast returned...

Link... Welcome... Listen carefully to what I, the Deku Tree,
am about to tell thee... Thy slumber these past moons must have been
restless, and full of nightmares... As the servants of evil gain
strength, a vile climate pervades the land and causes nightmares to
those sensitive to it... Verily, thou hast felt it...

Link... The time has come to test thy courage... I have been
cursed... I need you to break the curse with your wisdom and
courage. Dost thou have courage enough to undertake this task?

-----------------------------------------------------------
-(Yes)
* - The Deku Tree lowers the portion of its trunk that resembles a mouth.

Deku Tree : Then enter, brave Link, and thou too, Navi...

Navi the fairy... Thou must aid Link... and Link...When Navi speaks,
use {C Up} to listen well to her words of wisdom...

-(No)
Deku Tree : Perhaps you do not yet have confidence in your abilities...
Return to the Kokiri Forest to learn the skills of combat...
When thou art ready, return here and speak with me by using {Z}...
-----------------------------------------------------------


Inside the Deku Tree  


* - Deku Scrub 1 and 2 are located in different rooms.

DekuScrub1: Ow-ow-ow! Forgive me, master! If I give you a clue, will you let
me go? When you jump off a high cliff, if you hold {Control Stick}
forward, you will roll on the ground when you land and won't get
hurt from the fall. I can't guarantee it will work, though, if the
cliff is really, really high, heh heh!

Well, try it if you are feeling bold! Wah ha hah!

DekuScrub2: Please forgive me, master! I'll never do it again! If you spare me,
I'll teach you something cool. You will never beat my brothers up
ahead unless you punish them in the proper order. The order is...
2 3 1 Twenty-three is number one! Do you think I'm a traitor?

* - The third Deku Scrub is accompanied by two others.

DekuScrub3: How did you know our secret?! How irritating! It's so annoying that
I'm going to reveal the secret of Queen Gohma to you! In order to
administer the coup de grace to Queen Gohma, strike with your sword
while she's stunned.

Oh, Queenie... Sorry about that!

* - Upon defeating "Parasitic Armored Arachnid: Gohma", which is encountered in
the room past the third Scrub's locale, Link is teleported to the Deku
Tree's meadow.


Great Deku Tree's Meadow  


Deku Tree : Well done, Link... Thou hast verily demonstrated thy courage...
I knew that thou wouldst be able to carry out my wishes...

Now, I have yet more to tell ye, wouldst thou listen...

-----------------------------------------------------------
-(Yes)
&lt;see below&gt;

-(No)
Deku Tree : No, Link... Thou must know my time is short...
-----------------------------------------------------------

Deku Tree : Now...listen carefully... A wicked man of the desert cast this
dreadful curse upon me...

* - The man from Link's dream is depicted riding his horse through flames.

Deku Tree : This evil man ceaselessly uses his vile, sorcerous powers in his
search for the Sacred Realm that is connected to Hyrule... For it
is in that Sacred Realm that one will find the divine relic,
the Triforce, which contains the essence of the gods...

* - Three humanoid figures are shown descending from a sky.

Deku Tree : Before time began, before spirits and life existed... Three golden
goddesses descended upon the chaos that was Hyrule...

Din, the goddess of power... Nayru, the goddess of wisdom...
Farore, the goddess of courage...

Din... With her strong flaming arms, she cultivated the land and
created the red earth.

Nayru... Poured her wisdom onto the earth and gave the spirit of law
to the world.

Farore... With her rich soul, produced all life forms who would
uphold the law.

The three great goddesses, their labors completed, departed for
the heavens. And golden sacred triangles remained at the point where
the goddesses left the world. Since then, the sacred triangles have
become the basis for our world's providence. And, the resting place
of the triangles has become the Sacred Realm.

* - The imagery ceases, and the camera pulls away from the tree's mouth.

Deku Tree : Thou must never allow the desert man in black armor to lay his hands
on the sacred Triforce... Thou must never suffer that man, with his
evil heart, to enter the Sacred Realm of legend... That evil man who
cast the death curse upon me and sapped my power...

Because of that curse, my end is nigh... Though your valiant efforts
to break the curse were successful, I was doomed before you
started... Yes, I will pass away soon... But do not grieve for me...
I have been able to tell you of these important matters...

This is Hyrule's final hope... Link... Go now to Hyrule Castle...
There, thou will surely meet the Princess of Destiny...

Take this stone with you. The stone that man wanted to much,
that he cast the curse on me...

&lt;game&gt;    : You got the Kokiri's Emerald! This is the Spiritual Stone of the
Forest, now entrusted to you by the Great Deku Tree.

Deku Tree : The future depends upon thee, Link... Thou art courageous...

Navi the fairy... Help Link to carry out my will... I entreat ye...
Navi... Good...bye...

* - The Deku Tree begins to wither.

Navi      : Let's go to Hyrule Castle, Link!!

Good-bye...Great Deku Tree...

* - Navi pauses for a moment, before following Link out of the meadow.


Exiting the meadow  


Mido      : Hey, Link! What did you do?! The Great Deku Tree...did he...die?
How could you do a thing like that?! It's all your fault!!


Social Script

* - Link comes to a bridge, whereat Saria is present.

Saria     : Oh, you're leaving...

I knew...that you would leave the forest...someday, Link...
Because you are different from me and my friends... But that's OK,
because we'll be friends forever...won't we?

I want you to have this Ocarina... Please take good care of it.

&lt;game&gt;    : You received the Fairy Ocarina! This is a memento from Saria.
Set it to {C} and press {C} to start playing it! On the Select Item

Saria     : When you play my Ocarina, I hope you will think of me and come back

Near:  Kokiri Forest  


* - An owl named "Kaepora Gaebora" is perched atop a tree branch.

Gaebora   : Hoo hoot! Link... Look up here! It appears that the time has finally
come for you to start your adventure! You will encounter many
hardships ahead... That is your fate. Don't feel discouraged, even
during the toughest times!

Go straight this way and you will see Hyrule Castle. You will meet
a princess there... If you are lost and don't know which way to go,
look at the Map. The areas you have explored will be shown on the
Map. Press START to enter the Subscreens and {Z} or {R} to find the
Map. On the Map Subscreen, you will also see a flashing dot showing
you which way you should go next.

Did you get all that?

Gaebora   : All right then, I'll see you around! Hoot hoot hoot ho!


Near:  Kakariko Village  


Gaebora   : Hey, Link! Wait a second, friend! Beyond this point you'll find
Kakariko Village. Have you seen the Princess of Hyrule? If not,
I suggest you go to the castle.

Do you want to hear what I said again?

* - "Yes" prompts him to repeat himself from the beginning. "No" prompts:

Gaebora   : Link, you're the only one who can complete the quest ahead!
You must do your best! Hoo!


Near:  Lake Hylia  


Gaebora   : Beyond this point lies Lake Hylia. It is full of deep, pure water.
The Zoras, who live all the way upstream, guard the sunken temple
at the lake's bottom, as well as Zora's Fountain. If you want to
confirm its location on the map, press STAR to switch to the

Near:  Gerudo Valley  


Gaebora   : Link! Wait up, buddy! Hoo hoo! Head south from here to reach
Lake Hylia's full, rich waters. If you go west, you'll find Gerudo
Valley. There's a hideout of a gang of thieves on the other side of
the valley. Well, you're free to go anywhere you want! Ho ho ho...
hooo!

Do you want to hear what I said again?

* - "Yes" prompts him to repeat himself from the beginning. "No" prompts:

[004]     : I wanted to see Princess Zelda! I avoided the guards... Swam through
the moat... I was almost there when they caught me! I found a small
drain hole on the right side of the castle that I thought I could
sneak into, but I got stuck there.

[005]     : Do you know about the Temple of Time that we have in the northeast
part of town? Legends say that the Temple of Time is the entrance to
the Sacred Realm... Did you know that?

[006]     : Have you heard the legend of the "Shadow Folk"? They are the
Sheikah...the shadows of the Hylians. They say they swore allegiance
to the King of Hyrule and guarded the Royal Family. But with the
long peace, no one has seen a Sheikah around here for a long time.

However... I heard there is one Sheikah woman living in the
castle...

[007]     : I made a lot of money! Maybe I should go look for more things to
sell! I know! I should go to Lake Hylia! Many things float down
the river and end up there! Hah hah!

[008]     : Please...with {C}... Please sell me something... Please...with
{C}...

* - Nothing can be sold to [008] until a bottle is acquired,
in which case:

Please...with {C}... Please sell me the contents of a bottle...
Please...with {C}...

Oh, that's Blue Fire! I'll buy it for 150 Rupees!
Oh, it's a cute little Bug! I'll buy it for 50 Rupees.
Oh, a Fish! I'll buy it for 100 Rupees!

All sales final, OK?

* - If an unacceptable item is presented:

No... I can't take that... That's not what I want to buy.

[009]     : I'm not dancing, you know... my back itches! Ooh! Aaah! Ooh!

[010]     : Hey, forest boy! This is the city of Hyrule! Take your time and
enjoy the sights! If you came here to see Hyrule Castle, take the
street on your right. If you want to see the back alleys of the
town, take the street to the left.

[011]     : My precious puppy can run faster than any of the other mutts
around here!

[012]     : Kid, have you been to Lon Lon Ranch? Their milk is delicious! There
are many horses there, and the young daughter of the ranch owner is
cute! To get to Lon Lon Ranch, after you leave town, head due south
across the field. You should visit the ranch at least once!

* - [013] and [014] are dancing together.

[013-014] :{1} Ohh... You are...so handsome... Just like the King of Hyrule...
Hee hee...

{2} Ohh... You are...more beautiful...than Princess Zelda... Ohh...

[015]     : Ahem! Hrrrm! This beard is my pride and joy! Doesn't it look
luxuriant, kid?!

[016]     : Huff huff! I'm late! I'm late! For a very important date!

[017]     : I can't catch that Cucco!

[018]     : They say we Hylians have big ears in order to hear the voices of
the gods...but I've never heard them!

Crowds    :{1} Hey, have you heard that Princess Zelda sees prophetic visions
in her dreams?

{2} Hey, who bumped me?!

{3} Huh? What? Shoo, kid! Shoo!

{4} Hey, let go! It's mine! I found it first!

{5} C'mon, can't you make it any cheaper?

ghosts would come out or something... Hey, I'm really interested
in ghosts! Studying them is a hobby of mine, but you never know...
the time might come when that kind of knowledge might be useful!

Malon  


* - A girl named "Malon" is present in the market.

Malon     : Hey, your clothes! They're...different... You're not from around
here, are you? ................. Ohh... You're a fairy boy from
the forest! My name is Malon! My dad owns Lon Lon Ranch! Dad went
to the castle to deliver some milk, and he hasn't come back yet...

* - Once the castle grounds have been entered at least once, Malon appears there
on subsequent visits.

Malon     : Are you going to the castle, fairy boy? Would you mind finding my
dad? He must have fallen asleep somewhere around the castle.
What a thing for an adult to do! Tee hee!

Oh yeah, if you look for him, I'll give this to you. I've been
incubating this egg very carefully... Tee hee!

&lt;game&gt;    : You got a Weird Egg! Feels like there's something moving inside!
Set it to {C} and see what happens! On the Select Item Subscreen,
you can set it to {C Left}, {C Down} or {C Right}, and then press
{C} to use it.

Malon     : Set the egg to {C} to incubate it. Hee hee! My dad is really
troublesome, for an adult, isn't he?! hee hee!

* - Upon the arrival of 06:00:

Navi      : Look! A chicken hatched from the egg you were incubating! It's the
miracle of life!


Hyrule Castle exterior  


Gaebora   : Hey, Link! This way! The princess is inside the castle just ahead.
Be careful not to get caught by the guards! Ho ho ho hoot!

On this ground, time flows normally. But time stands still while
you are in Lon Lon Ranch or in a town. If you want time to pass
normally, you'll need to leave town.

Well, well, which way are you going to go now? Hoo hoo hoot!

Do you want to hear what I said again?

* - "Yes" prompts him to repeat himself from "On this ground". "No" prompts:

Gaebora   : Hoooo. You're a smart kid. Good luck, then. Hoo hoo.

* - A guard stands by a large gate.

Guard 01  : Welcome to Hyrule Castle Town. It's a peaceful, prosperous town.

* - Vines allow access to a cliff that leads past the gate. Upon being spotted
by the other guards:

Guards 02+: Hey you! Stop! You, kid, over there!

* - During the daytime, after having been caught at least once:

Guard 01  : So you say you want to see Princess Zelda, eh? You probably heard
about her in town and decided you had to meet her... Well...
Go home! Get out of here! The Princess would never grant an audience
to the likes of you!

* - Once Talon has been awoken:

Guard 01  : Do you really want to go through this gate that much? Let me think
about it... OK, but in return... Give me 10 Rupees...

-----------------------------------------------
-(Yes)
Well, maybe that's too much for a kid to pay.

* - With sufficient funds:

OK, I'll let you pass, quickly!

KEEP IT A SECRET FROM EVERYONE.

-(No)
Tsk Tsk.
-----------------------------------------------

* - A man named "Talon" is sleeping on the ground by the castle's walls.

Talon     : Z Z Z Z Z... Mumble mumble... Welcome...our ranch is so fun...
C'mon and look around...

* - The Weird Egg chicken wakes Talon via crowing.

Talon     : What in tarnation? Can't a person get a little shut-eye around here?

Hello, and who might you be? Yep, I'm Talon, the owner of Lon Lon
Ranch. I went to the castle to deliver some milk, but I sat down
here to rest, and I guess I fell asleep...

What?! Malon was looking for me? I'm gonna catch it from her now!
I messed up bad, leaving Malon behind to wait for me! She's really
gonna let me have it!

* - He frantically runs out of the area.

The two crates of milk that Talon delivered can be positioned so as to
allow Link to jump over the castle's moat and onto a ledge where he can
crawl through a hole from which water flows.

Eventually, Link reaches:


Castle Courtyard  


* - There are three windows here. In one window are paintings of Mario, Luigi,
Bowser, Peach, and Yoshi of the Mario videogame series.

Upon firing a seed from the slingshot into the second window, a guard speaks
from behind it and throws a bomb into the courtyard, saying:

Guard     : Hey you! Don't cause any trouble!

* - The princess is looking into the third window.

Zelda     : ! Who?! Who are you? How did you get past the guards?

Oh? What's that? Is that...a fairy?! Then, are you... Are you
from the forest? Then...then...you wouldn't happen to have...
the Spiritual Stone of the Forest, would you?! That green and
shining stone... Do you have it?

-----------------------------------------------------------
-(Yes)
&lt;see below&gt;

-(No)
Zelda     : Well, that's odd... I thought you might be the one from my dream...
You really don't have it? Tell me the truth... Do you have it?
-----------------------------------------------------------

Zelda     : Just as I thought!

I had a dream...In the dream, dark storm clouds were billowing over
the land of Hyrule... But suddenly, a ray of light shot out of the
forest, parted the clouds and lit up the ground... The light turned
into a figure holding a green and shining stone, followed by a
fairy...

I know this is a prophecy that someone would come from the forest...
Yes, I thought you might be the one...

Oh, I'm sorry! I got carried away with my story and I didn't even
properly introduce myself! I am Zelda, Princess of Hyrule.

What is your name? ..... Link... Strange...it sounds somehow...
familiar.

OK then, Link... I'm going to tell you the secret of the Sacred
Realm that has been passed down by the Royal Family of Hyrule.
Please keep this a secret from everyone...

-----------------------------------------------------------
-(OK)
&lt;see below&gt;

-(No)
Zelda     : C'mon...don't be a blabber-mouth! Please keep this a secret from
everyone...
-----------------------------------------------------------

Zelda     : The legend goes like this...

The three goddesses hid the Triforce containing the power of the
gods somewhere in Hyrule. The power to grant the wish of the one who
holds the Triforce in his hands. If someone with a righteous heart
makes a wish, it will lead Hyrule to a golden age of prosperity...
If someone with an evil mind has his wish granted, the world will
be consumed by evil...That is what has been told... So, the ancient
Sages built the Temple of Time to protect the Triforce from evil
ones.

That's right... The Temple of Time is the entrance through which
you can enter the Sacred Realm from our world. But the entrance is
sealed with a stone wall called the Door of Time. And, in order to
open the door, it is said that you need to collect three Spiritual
Stones.

And another thing you need...is the treasure that the Royal Family
keeps along with this legend... The Ocarina of Time!

Did you understand well the story I just told you?

-----------------------------------------------------------
-(Yes)
&lt;see below&gt;

-(No)
Zelda     : Oh, I'm sorry. I'm not very good at storytelling...

* - She repeats herself from "That's right..."
-----------------------------------------------------------

Zelda     : That's great!

I forgot to tell you... I was spying through this window just now...
The other element from my dream...the dark clouds... I believe they
symbolize...that man in there! Will you look through the window at
him?

-----------------------------------------------------------
-(Yes)
&lt;no script&gt;

-(No)
Zelda     : Please! If you don't hurry, he'll be gone!
-----------------------------------------------------------

* - Behind the window, the man from Link's dream kneels on the ground.

Zelda     : Can you see the man with the evil eyes? That is Ganondorf, the
leader of the Gerudos. They hail from the desert far to the west.
Though he swears allegiance to my father, I am sure he is not
sincere. The dark clouds that covered Hyrule in my dream...
They must symbolize that man!

* - He looks toward the window. Link backs up.

Zelda     : What happened? Did he see you? Don't worry. He doesn't have any idea
what we're planning...yet!

........Yes. I told my father about my dream... However, he didn't
believe it was a prophecy... But...I can sense that man's evil
intentions! What Ganondorf is after must be nothing less than the
Triforce of the Sacred Realm. He must have come to Hyrule to obtain
it! And, he wants to conquer Hyrule...no, the entire world!

Link...now, we are the only ones who can protect Hyrule! Please!

-----------------------------------------------------------
-(OK)
&lt;see below&gt;

-(I don't believe you.)
Zelda     : Please believe me... My prophecies have never been wrong! Please!
-----------------------------------------------------------

Zelda     : Thank you!

I...I am afraid... I have a feeling that man is going to destroy
Hyrule. He has such terrifying power! But it's fortunate that you
have come...

We must not let Ganondorf get the Triforce! I will protect the
Ocarina of Time with all my power! He shall not have it! You go find
the other two Spiritual Stones! Let's get the Triforce before
Ganondorf does, and then defeat him!

One more thing... Take this letter... I'm sure it will be helpful
to you.

&lt;game&gt;    : You received Zelda's Letter! Wow! This letter has Princess Zelda's
autograph! Set it to {C} and show it with {C}. On the Select Item
Subscreen, you can set it to {C left}, {C Down} or {C Right},
and then use that {C} to show it to people.

Zelda     : My attendant will guide you out of the castle. Don't be afraid to
talk to her.

* - Near the courtyard's entrance.

Impa      : I am Impa of the Sheikahs. I am responsible for protecting Princess
Zelda. Everything is exactly as the Princess foretold.

You are a courageous boy... You are heading out on a big, new
adventure, aren't you? My role in the Princess's dream was to
teach a melody to the one from the forest. This is an ancient
melody passed down by the Royal Family. I have played this song
for Princess Zelda as a lullaby ever since she was a baby...
There is mysterious power in these notes. Now listen carefully...

Memorize this song...

&lt;game&gt;    : You've learned Zelda's Lullaby!

Impa      : If the castle soldiers find you, there will be trouble. Let me lead
you out of the castle.

* - She takes Link to Hyrule Field.

Impa      : You brave lad... We must protect this beautiful land of Hyrule!

Take a good look at that mountain. That is Death Mountain, home of
the Gorons. They hold the Spiritual Stone of Fire.

At the foot of Death Mountain you will find my village, Kakariko.
That is where I was born and raised. You should talk to some of the
villagers there before you go up Death Mountain.

The song I just taught you has some mysterious power. Only Royal
Family members are allowed to learn this song. Remember, it will
help to prove your connection with the Royal Family.

The Princess is waiting for you to return to the castle with the
stones. All right. We're counting on you!

* - She tosses a Deku Nut to the ground. By the time that its light fades,
she is no longer present.

[ Outside ]
[001]     : Oh, you're OK? You didn't leave the forest after all, did you?

[002]     : Saria wanted to see you... Did she find you already?

[003]     : You have a cool Slingshot, huh? You know what's cool about it?
You can aim while holding down {C} and shoot by releasing the
button! How cool! If you have the Slingshot ready, you can use
{Z} Targeting to shoot while moving.... Did you know that?

[004]     : Did you know that if you hold {Control Stick} forward when you jump
off a cliff, you'll roll when you land. This will absorb the shock
of your landing. If you fall too far, though, you'll still get
hurt...

[005]     : Saria said she's waiting at the usual spot.

[006]     : Jumping is going out of style now. I'm crazy about doing backflips!
Can you do one?

[007]     : Mido might know something about Saria's whereabouts. I think Mido is
sulking in one of the houses around here.

[008]     : If you want to go to the Lost Woods, you'd better equip the right
gear! Hee hee!

[ Buildings ]
Mido      : If you're looking for Saria, she's in the Lost Woods, as usual.
Don't tell me you don't know where that is! The entrance is up
on the cliff overlooking the village! I know you'll get lost!
Don't worry, you'll just end up back at the entrance! Harumph!

* - House of Twins:

[012]     : Link, are you going to go away?

The "Area XX" portions precede the meadow.
The numbers have no bearing on the woods's layout.
Events transcribed in areas 03-07 are optional.


Area 01  


Gaebora   : Hey, over here! Hoo hoo! Link...good to see you again! Listen to
this! Hoot hoot...

After going through the Lost Woods, you will come upon the Sacred
Forest Meadow. That is a sacred place where few people have ever
walked.

Shhhh...What's that? I can hear a mysterious tune... You should
listen for that tune too... Hoo hoo ho!

Do you want to hear what I said again?

* - "Yes" prompts him to repeat himself from "After going". "No" prompts:

Gaebora   : If you are courageous, you will make it through the forest just
fine... Just follow your ears and listen to the sounds coming from
the forest! Hoot hoot!


Sacred Forest Meadow  


Saria     : I've been waiting for you, Link! This is the Sacred Forest Meadow.
It's my secret place! I feel... This place will be very important
for both of us someday. That's how I feel.

If you play the Ocarina here, you can talk with the spirits in the
forest. Would you like to play the Ocarina with me?

-----------------------------------------------------------
-(Yes)
&lt;no script&gt;

-(Don't do it)
Saria     : Huh?! How boring! C'mon! Play along!
-----------------------------------------------------------

Saria     : OK, try to follow along with the melody I will play. Are you ready?

&lt;game&gt;    : Follow along with Saria's Song!

Saria     : Great! Great! Please don't forget this song! Do you promise?
When you want to hear my voice, play Saria's Song. You can talk
with me anytime...

&lt;game&gt;    : You've learned Saria's Song!


Area 02  


Gaebora   : Hoo hoo! Did you learn an Ocarina song from Saria? That melody seems
to have some mysterious power. There may be some other mysterious
songs like this that you can learn in Hyrule.

If you hold the Ocarina with {C} where a melody is necessary,
a musical staff will appear. I recommend that you play a song you
know. I also suggest that you play even when a score is not
displayed, just like this: Hoo hoo hoo hoot hoot hoot!

Do you want to hear what I said again?

* - "Yes" prompts him to repeat himself from "If you hold". "No" prompts:

Gaebora   : Melodies you have learned will be recorded on the Quest Status
Subscreen. You should memorize those melodies.


Area 03  


* - A Skull Kid is playing a flute atop a tree stump. Link catches the Skull
Kid's attention by playing the Fairy Ocarina while on another stump.

SkullKid 1: That's not quite Saria's Song...

* - Upon playing Saria's Song:

SkullKid 1: You know Saria's Song! We should be friends! Here, take this!

* - He provides a Piece of Heart.

SkullKid 1: Hi! Do you think my face is kind of plain? It's just not very
unusual...

fired by the slingshot:

give a neat present to such a wonderful person! Please take it!

* - The Deku Scrub provides a "Deku Seeds Bullet Bag".

* - Two Skull Kids are standing on tree stumps. When Link readies his Ocarina
while standing on a third stump:

SkullKid 2: Follow along with our song on your Ocarina. We'll lead you into it.

* - Failure:

SkullKid 2: Too bad...Heh heh! Do you want to play some more?

* - "Yes" repeats the event from the beginning. "No" ends the event.

* - Success:

SkullKid 2: That was quite a nice session. As a token of our friendship,
please take this.

* - Initially, they provide a Green Rupee. They reward Link with a Blue Rupee
for his second successful session, a Piece of Heart for his third success,
and a Red Rupee per each success thereafter.

SkullKid 2: Do you want to play some more?

* - "Yes" repeats the event from the beginning. "No" ends the event.

[02'06] ---        Lon Lon Ranch        --- [02'06] 




Before having met Talon  


* - A man is present outside during the day, and in the stable at night.

Ingo      : What? What are you doing hanging around here? You little weirdo!
I am Ingo and I mind the ranch. I've been working at this ranch
for a long time for that lazy bum, Talon.

Today, for example, he's gone somewhere for a delivery and he hasn't
come back yet! So, I'm doing all the work around here.

Oh well...It's tough to be a working man.


After having met Talon  


* - Malon is singing in the fenced field.

Malon     : Oh, it's the fairy boy again! I heard that you found my dad!
How did you like the castle? Did you see the Princess? Hee hee!
Dad came home in a hurry after you found him. Hee hee!

Oh yeah, I have to introduce you to my friend, fairy boy!
She's this horse. Her name is Epona. Isn't she cute?

* - Epona runs away.

Malon     : It seems like Epona is afraid of you, fairy boy...

* - When speaking to her again:

Malon     : My mother composed this song. Isn't it nice? Let's sing together.

Oh, cute ocarina! Are you going to play this song with that ocarina?
OK? This is the Song...

&lt;game&gt;    : You've learned Epona's Song!

* - Epona returns.

Malon     : Oh, Epona! She's grown fond of you, fairy boy!

Talon     : Mumble...mumble... Huh? I'm awake already!

What? Well I'll be! If it ain't the forest kid from the other day!
By the way, thanks a lot for waking me up! It took some doing, but
I finally got Malon back in a good mood.

So, what are you up to today? Got some free time on your hands
you say? Well how about a little game? These three Cuccos I have
here are special Super Cuccos! I'm going to throw these Cuccos into
that there gaggle of normal Cuccos. If you can pick out these three
special birds from among the normal Cuccos within the time limit,
I'll give you something good. If you can't find them, I win.

It'll be 10 Rupees... Want to play?

-----------------------------------------------
-(Yes)
You don't have enough Rupees!

* - With sufficient funds:

You have 30 seconds! All righty then, get ready. Here go the
Super Cuccos! START LOOKIN'!!

Time's up! Too baaaaad!! These are some great Cuccos aren't they!
They're raking in money for me! Come back to me, my babies!

Want to try again? A young man like you must have a real fire in
your belly! Find three of them within 30 seconds. Try again for 5
Rupees?

That's one of 'em! Keep it up! Keep it up! Two more to find!

That's another! All right, now, the moment of truth! One more to
find!

Golly! I'll be darned! It's plum incredible! That's the last one!
You've found them all! Come on over here!

Hey, you! You've got the talent to be one of the world's best
cowboys! How'd you like to marry Malon? Huh?

* - "Yes" and "No" both prompt:

Haw haw! I was just kidding! Just kidding! I think you're a little
young for that, aren't you? Haw haw haw!

Oh...! I'm proud to present to you a sample of our very own Lon Lon
Milk. You'll be energized the moment you drink it! After you drink
it, you can bring back the bottle and buy a refill, anytime you
want!

-(No)
* - Nothing more is said.
-----------------------------------------------

Talon     : Mumble...mumble.. I'm awake!

What? Hey, Link! If you're lookin' for Malon, she's right outside.
Did you come here to play? Well then, how about playing the Super
Cucco-findin' game with me? Or, do you want to buy some Lon Lon
Milk? What'll it be?

-----------------------------------------------
-(Lon Lon Milk - 30 Rupees)
You don't have enough Rupees!

* - With sufficient funds:

If an empty bottle is available, he provides Lon Lon Milk.
If not:

Here you are! take some super fresh milk... Oh? Too baaaaad!!
You don't have an empty bottle, do you?

-(Cucco-findin' game - 10 Rupees)
* - After the "Golly!" paragraph:

Hey pardner, you have an honest face! When you grow up, why don't
you come to work here, on this ranch? That's a standing offer!
I'll be waiting for you.

* - If an empty bottle is available, he provides Lon Lon Milk.
If not:

Here you are! take some super fresh milk... Oh? Too baaaaad!!
You don't have an empty bottle, do you?

-(Quit)
* - Nothing more is said.
-----------------------------------------------

Ingo      : I can't believe that I, the great Ingo, am working on this dump of
a ranch! Because the owner is so lazy, I always have to do to all
the work around here! I, the hard-working Ingo, should be in charge,
not that lazy bum, Talon!

* - When trying to enter Malon/Talon's residence at night, Talon shouts from
inside.

Talon     : Malon's gone to sleep! I'm goin' to sleep now, too. Come back again
when it's light out!

Social Script  -  Daytime  


[ Outside ]
[001]     : Ding dong, ding dong! I'm a clock soldier of Kakariko! The current
time is: &lt;:&gt;.

Hello there, son. Zelda's attendant, the great Impa, opened this
village to the common people. We have only a small population now,
but someday this place will be as lively as Hyrule Castle Town!
Oh, yes! It will!

Climb up the stairs at the north end of the village to find the
trail that leads up Death Mountain. But you need the King's
permission to actually go up the mountain.

Crptr Boss: I am the boss of the carpenters that Impa hired to improve this
village and make it into a true city! But young men these days
don't have any ambition... Do you know what I mean, kid?

My workers are just running aimlessly around the village, and
they're not making any progress at all... Even my own son doesn't
have a job, and he just wanders around all day!

They're all worthless, I tell you!!

Jiro      : All day long, we are working on many construction projects in the
village. It's going to take awhile [sic] before everything is done.
Our boss works us very hard!

Sabooru   : Look at that poor girl over there. She works so hard taking care of
her chickens, even though touching them gives her goose bumps...
What a trooper! I would really like to help her! I've just been
feeling so charitable these days! Don't you feel that way, too?

Shiro     : Have you seen Mr. Dampé, who lives in the graveyard up ahead?

It's &lt;:&gt; right now, so he's probably asleep in his hut.
Why don't you go out onto the field and kill some time?

[006]     : This used to be the great Impa's house, but she doesn't live here
any longer. It is now open to all villagers. You are free to go on
in.

This village used to be a Sheikah village, but the great Impa opened
it to everyone.

* - [007] is on the roof of Granny's Potion Shop.

[007]     : I can't get down, so all I can do is look at Death Mountain.

* - When speaking to him while on the roof:

Hey! Good to see you again! I'll give you this as a memento.

* - He provides a Piece of Heart.

To get a good view, use {C Up} and look around with {Control Stick}.

[008]     : What should I do!? My Cuccos have all flown away! You, little boy,
please! Please help me bring them back to this pen!

My Cuccos have run away! Please catch six more!

I'm still missing some Cuccos! Please round up five more!

My Cuccos have run away Please help me bring the other
&lt;four/three/two&gt; back to this pen! Please!

My Cuccos have run away Please help me bring the last one back to
this pen! Please!

Thank you for finding my Cuccos. I have allergies, so I get goose
bumps when I touch them. For helping me, I will give this to you.
It's fine glass, and should be useful. Please take good care of it!

* - She provides an Empty Bottle. On subsequent collections of
her Cuccos, she provides a Purple Rupee.

When speaking to her again:

Please don't tease my Cuccos!

Sign 01   : Dark! Narrow! Scary!

* - Impa's house:

[009]     : Hey! Kid, do you always enter other people's houses without
permission? Didn't your parents teach you any manners? Oh well.

Did you see a lady behind this house? She's going through hard
times. Oh well. If that lady asks you about chickens, you should
listen to her.

-----

[010]     : Hi, boy! Is this the first time you've visited this village?
A great woman, Impa, opened this village to us poor folk.
Well, make yourself at home. The food isn't ready yet, though.

-----
* - House of Skulltula:

The residents are large Skulltula with partially-human faces and, in the
case of [011], arms.

[011]     : We all look like this because of the spider's curse. If every Spider
of the Curse in the entire world were destroyed, the curse would be
broken.

When you destroy a Spider of the Curse, a token will appear. Collect
it as proof of your achievement. The number next to this icon on the
Quest Status Subscreen indicates how many Spiders of the Curse you
have destroyed so far. When this icon is displayed next to the name
of the area on the Map Subscreen, there are no more Spiders in that
area. Look for them not only out in the open, but also inside the
dungeons.

Of course, this is just our dream... You don't have to do it if you
don't want to... If you break the curse on my family, we will make
you very rich...

[012-016] : Yeaaarrgh! I'm cursed!!

* - After killing enough spiders to break at least one person's curse:

[011]     : Since you've destroyed &lt;&gt; Spiders of the Curse, the curse is
starting to weaken! Did the kids who returned to normal give you
any rewards? You should know that the only way to become very rich
is to destroy as many Spiders of the Curse as possible!

There are some tricks to finding them all! First of all, you'll have
to hunt at night. Secondly, keep in mind that they love soft soil...
Pay close attention to your surroundings! Please, we're counting on
you!

[012-016] : The curse has been broken! Thank you! Here's a reward for you!

Please save my other brothers too! I'm sure they will give you
something a lot better! Will you do it?!

* - [012], freed by acquiring 10 tokens, provides the Adult's Wallet.
[013], freed by acquiring 20 tokens, provides the Stone of Agony.
[014], freed by acquiring 30 tokens, provides the Giant's Wallet.
[015], freed by acquiring 40 tokens, provides ten Bomchus.
[016], freed by acquiring 50 tokens, provides a Piece of Heart.

One-hundred tokens are required to free [011]. Upon speaking to him:

[011]     : Since you've destroyed 100 Spiders of the Curse, the curse on me
has been broken. Thank you! Here is a token of my appreciation!
Please take it.

* - [011] provides a Huge Rupee, and continues to do so on Link's subsequent
visits to the house.

[011]     : We'll be careful not to get cursed again.

[012-016] : I'm so happy everyone is back to normal!

-----

* - This building appears to be a shop, but nothing is laid out for sale,
and no one is behind the counter.

Ichiro    : A job where you can make a lot of money without much effort...
The only thing I can think of is thievery... Is that a bad idea?

* - When trying to enter this building from the back door:

Ichiro    : Who's there? What a bad kid, trying to enter from the rear door!
Such a bad kid... I have to tell you some juicy gossip!

The boss carpenter has a son... He's the guy who sits under the tree
every night... Don't tell the boss I told you that!

* - [019] speaks from behind the house's door.

[019]     : My little boy isn't here right now... I think he went to play in
the graveyard...

[ Graveyard ]
[021]     : Little kids can't go on the "Heart-Pounding Gravedigging Tour"
described on the sign. Since I can't do that, I'm just imitating
Dampé the gravekeeper all day. But with my cute face, I'm not
heart-pounding at all, am I?

Don't cause trouble! I'll tell Dampé!

* - When trying to enter Dampé's hut:

Dampé     : Be quiet! It's only &lt;:&gt;! I, Dampé the gravekeeper, am in bed

[ Outside ]
[001]     : Hey, son, what are you doing wandering around this late at night?
Oh, I get it. You're testing your courage, aren't you? You must want
to go to...a graveyard!

Wait a minute! What am I doing talking to a kid? I've got work to
do! Work! Work!

Ding dong, ding dong! The current time is: &lt;:&gt;.

Head east and you'll find a graveyard. Legends say you can calm the

Dampé     : Hey kid! Don't mess around with the graves!

I'm Dampé the Gravekeeper! My face may be scary, but I'm not a bad

Let me give you an advertisement for my side business... Dampé the
Gravekeeper's Heart-Pounding Gravedigging Tour! What's gonna come

Do you want me to dig here? 10 Rupees for one hole.

-(Yes)
You don't have enough Rupees!

Nope, nothing here!

* - He does not comment upon anything that is retrieved.

-(Don't do it)
Thanks a lot!

* - When trying to enter Dampé's hut, depending on the time:

Dampé     : It's &lt;:&gt; now. The Gravedigging Tour is over now! I, Dampé the

Sun's Song  


* - A ghost appears upon examining the second or third tombstone in the
graveyard. Upon defeating it:

Ghost     : GYAAAAH! YOU KILLED ME...Unbelievable!

Oh, what? You're not one of Ganondorf's men, are you? Because of my
role as a ghost, I had to act like that. I apologize.

Now then, let me introduce myself. Ahem... I am one of the ghostly
composer brothers of Kakariko Village. All the people in this
village are born to serve the Royal Family of Hyrule. We brothers
also served the Royal Family, and were assigned to study the
hereditary mystic powers of the family.

Though we never could figure out the power of the Triforce, we had
almost completed our study of controlling time with the tones of
ocarinas. Uh, I mean... Actually, we did complete that study!
We would have been famous, if that hateful Ganondorf had not tried
to steal our results. We could never let him reap the fruits of
our research! That's why we gave our lives to protect the secret.

Do you want to hear what I said again?

* - "Yes" prompts him to repeat himself from "I am one of". "No" prompts him to
disappear.

* - Upon defeating the other tombstone's ghost, or defeating the same ghost
for a second time:

Ghost     : GYAAAAH! I'M DEAD AGAIN! What? You again?

Somehow, you remind me of... Princess Zelda... Hmm... Since you may
have some connection with the Royal Family, I will tell you a little
more of our tale.

Back then, people called us great composers because of the many
musical masterpieces we wrote. But we brothers were not just
composers. We had a mission to analyze the mysterious powers of
Hyrule's Royal Family. Our names would be a part of Hyrule's history
if we could complete our research!

We kept our study extremely secret until we completed it. To tell
the truth, each of us was studying a different song, one to summon
the sun and another to summon the moon. If you were really sent by
a member of the Royal Family, I will tell you about the results of
our study.

We inscribed it on the royal tombstone. As a messenger of the Royal
Family, you should show your Royal credentials on top of the
Triforce mark...

Do you want to hear what I said again?

* - "Yes" prompts him to repeat himself from "I am one of". "No" prompts him to
disappear.

* - Upon playing Zelda's Lullaby on the Triforce mark on the ground near the
Royal Family's Tomb, the tombstone is destroyed by a bolt of lightning.

Within the tomb, upon examining skeletal remains:

&lt;game&gt;    : Shine light on the living dead...

Those who break into the Royal Tomb will be obstructed by the
lurkers in the dark...

* - Deeper inside the tomb, there is writing on a wall.

Tablet    : This poem is dedicated to the memory of the dearly departed members
of the Royal Family.

The rising sun will eventually set.
A newborn's life will fade.

From sun to moon, moon to sun...

Give peaceful rest to
the living dead.

Navi      : This is an interesting poem...huh? Something is inscribed on the
tombstone... It's the secret melody of the Composer Brothers!

&lt;game&gt;    : Keep the Sun's Song in your heart.

You've learned the Sun's Song!

Tablet    : Restless souls wander
where they don't belong.
bring [sic] them calm with
the Sun's Song.

* - Outside, upon defeating the ghost of either Sharp or Flat:

Ghost     : GYAAAAH! You killed me!! Huh? Oh, it's you.

Did you try to play the Sun's Song? Like I told you before, with
that song, you can turn day to night or night to day whenever you
want. When you're in darkness, that song should bring the sun's
light to you. You should try it.


Death Mountain gate  


Sign      : No passage without a Royal Decree!

Guard     : The road is closed beyond this point! Can't you read the sign over
there? Eh? Oh, I see. You're just a kid, and you can't read yet.
Ha ha hah!

* - Upon presenting Zelda's Letter to the guard:

Guard     : Oh, this is... This is surely Princess Zelda's handwriting!
Well, let's see... Hmmm... OK...

"This is Link... He is under my orders to save Hyrule."

Wah ha ha ha hah! What kind of funny game has our Princess come up
with now?!

OK, OK, all right.  You can go now... Just be careful, Mr. Hero!
Wah hah ha ha hah!

* - He opens the gate.

Guard     : By the way, Mr. Hero... If you're going to climb Death Mountain, you
should equip a proper shield! It is an active volcano, after all!
If you go back to Hyrule Castle Town Market, you should check out
the Bazaar. They sell the shield you need there. Tell 'em I sent you
and they should give you a special discount! If you think you're
good to go already, don't worry about it.

Now, I'd like to ask a favor of you. No, I don't expect you to do it
just because of the great tip I just gave you! I'm just asking!

Have you been to the Happy Mask Shop that just opened in the Hyrule
Castle Town Market? Everyone is talking about it! My little boy
pesters me for a popular mask, but I don't have time to go there...
So, could you go and get the mask for me next time you are in the
Market? If you don't feel like it, that's OK, but... Well, I have no
choice, this is my job...

...sigh...

* - For additional script with this man, refer to 03'04.

When speaking to him again:

Guard     : I wish I could go to the mask shop in town to buy a present for my
kid... ...sigh...



[02'08] ---        Death Mountain       --- [02'08] 




Death Mountain Trail  


[001]     : I am one of the Gorons, the stone-eating people who live on Death
Mountain.

Look at that huge boulder over there! It blocks the entrance to the
Dodongo's Cavern, which was once a very important place for us
Gorons... But one day, many Dodongos suddenly appeared inside the
cavern. It became a very dangerous place! On top of that, a Gerudo
man in black armor used his magic to seal the entrance with that
boulder!

If you want to hear more Goron gossip, head up to our city!
Goron City is just a little way up on the trail. It won't take much
longer to get there, even on foot.

[002]     : They say that a beautiful fairy lives on top of Death Mountain!
Don't you want to see her?

[003]     : I wish I could roll down the mountain like a rock, with a Bomb
Flower and... BOOOOOOM! If I could do that with a Bomb Flower,
I could become a real man.

[004]     : I'm standing here to shade the Bomb Flowers from the sun. Do you
have a question for me?

-----------------------------------------------
-(Ask about Bomb Flowers)
Those plants growing over there are Bomb Flowers. They are "mining
plants" that grow only on this mountain. They usually grow only in
dark places, like caves, so Bomb Flowers that grow in a place like
this are extremely rare. If you have the Goron's Bracelet, even a
little kid like you could easily pick it up with {A}.

-(Ask about Dodongo's Cavern)
Did you see the cavern on your way here? That is the Dodongo's
Cavern. Because the light inside is very dim, the Bomb Flowers,
a plant unique to this mountain, grow like crazy in there!
-----------------------------------------------

Sign 01   : Dodongo's Cavern
Don't enter without permission!

Sign 02   : Follow the trail along the edge of the cliff and you will reach
Goron City, home of the Gorons.

Goron City  -  Social Script  


[ Level 1 ]
[001]     : Oh...I'm so hungry... Everyone feels faint from hunger because of
the food shortage in this town. We are in danger of extinction!
It's all because we can't enter oru quarry, the Dodongo's Cavern.

We Gorons live on a diet of rocks... And the most delicious and
nutritious rocks around are found in the Dodongo's Cavern! But that
seems like ancient history now... We've become such gourmets that
we can't stand to eat rocks from anywhere else!

Sigh... I want to eat the top sirloin rocks from the Dodongo's
Cavern!

* - [002] is on a platform suspended by ropes.

[002]     : Hey! It's dangerous for a little kid like you to come out here.
You might fall down!

If I'm not mistaken, you came out here to eat the red stone!
Well, too bad! It's not here!

What? That's not why you're here? You're looking for a "Spiritual
Stone?" You must mean that delicious-looking red stone that was once
displayed here! I was so hungry that I thought it would be OK to
just give it one tiny little lick...so I snuck out here. But, it was
already gone!

I think Big Brother took it away. He always says that everyone is
after that red stone! Big Brother has shut himself up in his room
saying, "I will wait in here for the Royal Family's messenger!"

* - Upon examining the place where the Spiritual Stone had been:

&lt;game&gt;    : It looks like something used to be set in this stand...

[ Level 2 ]
Sign 01   : If you can stop my wild rolling, you might get something great.
--Hot Rodder Goron

* - [003], the Goron on this level, cannot currently be stopped.

[ Level 3 ]
[004]     : I'm so hungry that I can't think about anything but food!

"Spiritual Stone?" That red stone that was lighting up our city?
Big Brother Darunia took it away. Then, he shut himself up in his
room and won't come out. Since then, it feels like all the lights
in the city have gone out... Everyone seems so...depressed...
I want you to bring fire from Big Brother's room back here.

[005]     : Oh? We don't get many visitors way up here. Where are you from?
The forest? What's a "forest"? Eh? It's where a lot of "trees" and
"plants" grow? Now I'm even more confused! Nothing grows around
here besides the Bomb Flowers... We don't have "seeds" or "nuts"
around here either. Even Deku Sticks are very scarce around here!

I know a trick to conserve sticks! If you light a stick on fire,
it will burn to ashes. Press {A} to put it away before it completely
burns! By the way, I hid a stick somewhere... Hehehee...

[ Level 4 ]
[006]     : Big Brother has shut himself up in his room saying, "I will wait
in here for the Royal Family's messenger!"

* - Upon examining the carpet near the door to Darunia's room:

&lt;game&gt;    : You're standing on a soft carpet for guests... It feels so plush
under your feet!


Goron City  -  Darunia  


* - Access to Darunia's room can be gained by playing Zelda's Lullaby while
standing on the carpet near his room's door.

Darunia   : What the heck! Who are you?! When I heard the song of the Royal
Family, I expected their messenger had arrived, but...you're just
a little kid! Has Darunia, the big boss of the Gorons, really lost
so much status to be treated like this by his Sworn Brother,
the King? Now, I'm REALLY angry! Get out of my face, now!

Are you asking why I'm in such a bad mood right now? Ancient
creatures have infested the Dodongo's Cavern! We've had a poor
harvest of our special crop, Bomb Flowers! Starvation and hunger
because of the rock shortage!

But... This is a Goron problem! We don't need any help from
strangers!

* - Upon playing Saria's Song, Darunia begins to dance wildly.

Darunia   : Oh! Oh-oh! C'mon! Come on! Come on! Come on! HOT!! What a hot beat!
WHOOOOAH! YEEEEAH! YAHOOO!!

Heeey!! What a nice tune! Just like that, my depression is all gone!
Something just came over me! I suddenly wanted to dance like crazy!

I am Darunia! I'm the big boss of the Gorons! Was there something
you wanted to ask me about?

What? You want the Spiritual Stone of Fire, too? The Spiritual Stone
of Fire, also known as the Goron's Ruby, is our race's hidden
treasure... But hold on--I'm not going to give it to you that
easily, if you want it so badly...

Why don't you go destroy the monsters inside of the Dodongo's Cavern
and prove you're a real man? That way, everybody will be happy
again! If you do it, I will give you anything you want, even the
Spiritual Stone!

I have something for you. I'm not really giving you this in return
for anything, but take it anyway. If you wear this, even a little
fella like you can pick up a Bomb Flower using {A}.

&lt;game&gt;    : You got the Goron's Bracelet! Now you can pull up Bomb Flowers.
Stand next to one and use {A} to pull it up!


Goron City  -  Social Script  


[ Level 2 ]
[003]     : Why did you stop me? Don't stop me here! You can't stop my wild
rolling! This wild rolling is the only way to relieve my stress!

Now stand in awe of my wild, wild rolling!!

* - Bomb Flowers can be used to clear the path to a large Goron.

Medigoron : I'm working on something really cool right now! But I think it's
going to take a while... If you can wait five or six years,
it should be ready, OK?

[ Level 3 ]
* - Using a Deku Stick, fire from the torches in Darunia's room can be retrieved
and employed to light the two torches on this level. After doing so:

[004]     : How was Big Brother? I see... By the way, do you know the music
coming from deep inside of this tunnel? We all like this music!

* - The tunnel, blocked by boulders, leads to the Lost Woods.

[ Level 4 ]
[006]     : When all the torches on this floor are lit, Goron City is really
lively!

* - Lighting them causes an enormous vase to spin about the room. Upon tossing
a bomb inside of it, items are dispensed.

An ignited Deku Stick can be used to trigger the explosion of Bomb Flowers
that are positioned in such a manner as to open the path to the Goron Shop.

[007] ^   : Are you going to clear out the Dodongos? It's a Goron problem,
though. You're a nosey little kid, aren't you?! Well, of course
we'll be happy if you fix it so we can get all the Bombs we want,
like we used to... Just let me warn you, though... Dodongos are
scary creatures! They'll eat ANYTHING!! So watch yourself, and
don't get eaten!

* - After having destroyed the boulder with a Bomb Flower:

[001]     : Oh, now we can enter the cavern. You're so smart!


Dodongo's Cavern  


* - In the cavern's main room, there is an enormous rock structure in the shape
of a Dodongo's head on a wall.

On a high ledge, there is a stone with words written upon it.

Stone     : Giant dead Dodongo...
when it sees red,
a new way to go
will be open.

* - Dropping bombs into the head's eyes will cause its eye sockets to turn red.
When both are red, it opens its mouth, revealing a door at its throat.

* - In one of the cavern's rooms is a hole that leads to a large chamber,
in the middle of which is a pool of lava. "Infernal Dinosaur: King Dodongo"
walks and rolls about the edge of the room.

Upon defeating the boss, a circle of light appears, which teleports Link to:


Death Mountain Trail  


* - Darunia drops down from above. He pats Link on his head, which--Gorons being
rather forceful--knocks him to the ground.

Darunia   : It's me, Darunia! Well done! Thanks to you, we can once again eat
the delicious rocks from the Dodongo's Cavern until our stomachs
burst!

What a wild adventure! It will make an incredible story... I can't
believe that the Dodongos suddenly appeared in such great numbers!

And that big rock blocking the cave... All this trouble must have
been caused by that Gerudo thief, Ganondorf! He said, "Give me the
Spiritual Stone! Only then will I open the cave for you!"

You, on the other hand, risked your life for us... Kid, I like you!
How's about you and I become Sworn Brothers?! No, there's no big
ceremony involved! Just take this as a token of our friendship!

&lt;game&gt;    : You obtained the Goron's Ruby! This is the Spiritual Stone of Fire
passed down by the Gorons!

You don't know what he means by "Sworn Brothers," but you've
collected two Spiritual Stones! You have one more to find!

Darunia   : Brother! You'll keep brushing up on your skills as you travel, won't
you? You should go see the Great Fairy on top of Death Mountain!
She will power you up!

Hey, everybody! Let's see off our Brother!

* - Two Gorons fall into the area.

Gorons    : You did great! How 'bout a big Goron hug, Brother?!

* - They approach Link, who quickly begins to run. A third Goron blocks Link's
path down the mountain, so he heads upward.


Death Mountain Trail  -  Social Script  


[1, 3, 4] : You are incredible, destroying the Dodongos! Do you mind if I call

Beware of intense heat!

Gaebora   : You've done well to come all the way up here, Link. This is the
summit of the sacred Death Mountain! Hoot!

It is said that the clouds surrounding this peak reflect the
condition of Death Mountain. When they look normal, it is at peace.

Climbing all the way up here just proves how smart you are! Now I
want to see you make another smart move...

The Great Fairy lives on this mountaintop, and she will give you
a new skill! She is the leader of the fairies, you know.

Hoo! I will perch here and wait for you. When you're ready to go
back down, I can help you! Now, get going!

* - Upon examining a certain wall:

Navi      : ...???

* - The wall can be destroyed, opening the path to a Great Fairy's Fountain.

GreatFairy: Welcome Link! I am the Great Fairy of Power! I'm going to grant you
a sword technique. Receive it now!

&lt;game&gt;    : You mastered the secret sword technique of the Spin Attack! Hold {B}
to charge your weapon! Release {B} to unleash a wave of energy with
your spin! If you want to release energy without charging your
weapon, just rotate {Control Stick} once and press {B} for a very
effective quick spin!

GreatFairy: When you charge power for a Spin Attack, Magic Power will be
consumed. Pay attention to your green Magic Meter!

Hey, boy! You're a messenger of the Royal Family, aren't you?
Next time you're in their neighborhood, you should drop in on
a friend of mine who lives by Hyrule Castle. She'll surely grant
you another new power!

When battle has made you weary, please come back to see me.

* - After having met with the Great Fairy:

Gaebora   : Hoo hoot! Well, it looks like you've grown up a little from the
Great Fairy's power... But you still don't really look like the
hero who will save Hyrule. At least not yet!

If you are going back down the mountain, I can lend you a wing.
Come here and grab my talons! And hold on tight! Hoo hooooooot!

* - Upon stepping on a certain log:

&lt;game&gt;    : Some frogs are looking at you from underwater...

* - Upon drawing the Ocarina, the five frogs--each colored differently--jump out
of the water and onto other logs. Each frog corresponds to a button:
Dark blue to C Left, yellow to C Down, red to C Right, gray to C Up,

so fine...ribbit! We all should practice it, ribbit! Take Rupees
as a souvenir! If you come up with another nice melody, please drop
by and play it...Ribbit ribbit!

* - If a frog grew, then they provide a Purple Rupee;
otherwise, they provide a Blue Rupee.

* - Upon playing the Song of Storms:

Frog      : Wow, that melody is so cool! Ribbit! Siiiiingin' in the raaaaaain,
Oh [sic] what a feeling! Rrrrrribbbit!! Please take this as a token
of our froggish gratitude, ribbit! All right. See you, ribbit!

Frog      : Look at us, we're all huge frogs!! We are the world famous Fabulous
Five Froggish Tenors!! Rrrribbit!! Make us jump so we can eat the
bugs flying above us, ribbit! OK? Then, ready, set, go!

* - If the frogs are properly conducted:

Young boy, you did grrreat! Perrrrrfect! We are stuffed, ribbit!
Would you take this token of our gratitude?

So...you say you have some connection with Hyrule's Royal Family...
Well, what do you want from us?

[001]     : Zora's Fountain is the source of the river. Lord Jabu-Jabu lives
in the fountain. Lord Jabu-Jabu is the patron deity of the Zoras.
Princess Ruto is in charge of preparing his meals, morning and
night.

[002]     : We Zoras all serve the great King Zora.

[003]     : Have you seen Lord Jabu-Jabu?

-----------------------------------------------
-(Yes)
According to the "Legend of Zora," the act of offering a fish to
Lord Jabu-Jabu will make you happy.

-(No)
Oh, that's not good. Everybody who comes around here should see
Lord Jabu-Jabu at least once! Zora's Fountain is just beyond King
Zora's throne. That is where Lord Jabu-Jabu swims. But...unless you
have King Zora's permission, you can't go to Zora's Fountain.
-----------------------------------------------

[004]     : We haven't found Princess Ruto even though some of us have searched
as far as Lake Hylia...

[005]     : All of the water in Hyrule flows from Zora's Fountain. That water
flows through Zora's River, which eventually reaches Lake Hylia
to the south.

[006]     : We are good at diving! How about you? If you want to be a master
diver, try the diving game at the top of the waterfall! Have you
tried it already?

[007]     : I want to buy a fish, but they are a little too expensive... I have
no choice but to catch one of the fishes [sic] that's swimming
around out there.

OKAY! Pick up all the Rupees I throw from here. You have only a
limited amount of time! When you pick them all up, come back here!
I'll give you something very nice! START!

Go over the falls for a shortcut.

Too bad! Practice hard and come back!

Hey!  Congratulations! I've got something very nice for you!
Come and get it!

What a graceful dive! Now, please take this! This is a "scale" of
our kind. With this, you can dive much deeper under the water.

You should look at the Map Subscreen sometimes.

lake bottom there is a Water Temple used to worship the water
spirits. The Zoras are guardians of the temple. Hoo hoo.

The Zoras come from Zora's Domain in northeast Hyrule. An aquatic
race, they are longtime allies of Hyrule's Royal Family. I heard
that only the Royal Family of Hyrule can enter Zora's Domain.
Hoo hoo!

She's inside Lord Jabu-Jabu? That's not possible! Our guardian god,
Lord Jabu-Jabu, would never eat my dear Princess Ruto!

But since that stranger, Ganondorf, came here, Lord Jabu-Jabu has
been a little green around the gills... The evidence seems clear.
Of course, you'll go find Ruto. You can pass through here to the

I'll keep this letter. You keep the bottle it was in. Take it
respectfully! Please find my dear Princess Ruto immediately... Zora!

Inside Jabu-Jabu's Belly  


Ruto      : You! Who are you?!

I am Ruto, Princess of the Zoras. What?! Are you saying my father
asked you to come here to save me? I'd never ask anyone to do such
a thing! "Letter in a Bottle?"  I have no idea what you're talking
about! My father is worried about me? I don't care!

Anyway, I can't go home right now. And you... Get out of here!
Understand?!

* - She falls down a hole.

Ruto      : Ooooh Noooooo!

* - Link follows her.

Ruto      : Are you still hanging around here? I told you to go away!

I'm OK. I've been going inside Lord Jabu-Jabu's belly since I was
little, but... Lord Jabu-Jabu is very strange today... There are
electrified jellyfish and strange holes around... On top of that,
my precious stone was...but... That's none of your business!

Anyway... You! Go home now! Understand?!

* - Upon speaking to her again:

Ruto      : You're that worried about me? Then I will give you the honor of
carrying me!

However...I won't leave until I find the thing I'm looking for.
You'd better believe me!

* - If Ruto is left behind:

Ruto      : How inconsiderate! How could you leave me behind?! If you're a man,
act like one! Take responsibility!

* - The Spiritual Stone of Water rests on a platform in a certain room.

Ruto      : That's it! That's what I've been looking for! Throw me up there!
Onto the platform!

&lt;game&gt;    : Princess Ruto got the Spiritual Stone! But why Princess Ruto?

Ruto      : Oh my goodness! I finally found... My mother's stone... I got very
upset when Lord Jabu-Jabu swallowed it... While I was feeding him,
he suddenly swallowed me! I was so surprised I dropped it inside...

But, now that I've found it, I don't need to be in here anymore!
So, take me home, right now!

* - As Link approaches the platform, it rises to another room.

Ruto      : Keeeyaaaah! What is this?!  An octopus?!

* - The platform brings a Bigocto to Link's location.

Ruto is no longer present by the time that Link defeats the enemy and
rides the platform to the above room.

* - In one of the rooms, Link encounters "Bio-electric Anemone: Barinade".
Upon defeating it, a circle of light appears, inside which Ruto is hovering
in the air, and also blushing.

Ruto      : You...You're late! What took you so long! You're useless! I was just
lonely, that's all... Just a little!

* - They are teleported onto a fallen tree trunk in Zora's Fountain. Link,
startled by how close Ruto is to him, moves backward and falls off of
the trunk. Ruto jumps into the water

Ruto      : You! You looked cool...cooler than I thought you would, anyway...
Just a little!

Well, anyway, you saved me, so I guess I'll reward you. What do you
wish? Just tell me...

-----------------------------------------------------------
-(I want that Spiritual Stone.)
Ruto      : You mean the Spiritual Stone of Water, Zora's Sapphire, don't you?

-(Nothing really...)
Ruto      : Heeheehee... Don't be shy. I can tell what you're thinking...
-----------------------------------------------------------

Ruto      : My mother gave it to me and said I should give it only to the man
who will be my husband. You might call it the Zora's Engagement
Ring!

All right! I'll give you my most precious possession: Zora's
Sapphire!

&lt;game&gt;    : You obtained Zora's Sapphire! This is the Spiritual Stone of Water
passed down by the Zoras!

Her most precious possession? You don't know what she's talking
about, but you've finally collected all three Spiritual Stones!!
Go back to see Princess Zelda!

Ruto      : Don't tell my father...


Zora's Domain  -  Social Script  


[1, 3, 5] : Oh, it's you, Link! Thanks to you, Lord Jabu-Jabu is back to normal!

[2, 4]    : Oh, hi Link! You're all Princess Ruto will talk about lately!

Ruto      : Did my most precious possession help you in your quest? Heehee!

King Zora : Oh, Link! So, you saved the Princess, eh? I really appreciate it!



[02'12] ---      Hyrule Castle Town     --- [02'12] 




Hyrule Field  


* - Link comes to the town's entrance after nightfall, during a rainstorm.
The drawbridge lowers, allowing Impa and Zelda to exit upon a horse.
Before being carried out of sight, Zelda throws an item in Link's direction,
which lands in the moat surrounding Hyrule Castle Town.

Ganondorf soon emerges from the town upon his own horse.

Ganondorf : Arrrrgh! I lost her!

You, over there! Little kid! You must have seen the white horse
gallop past just now... Which way did it go?! Answer me!!

So, you think you can protect them from me... You've got guts, kid.

* - Link readies his sword.

Ganondorf : Heh heh heh... You want a piece of me?! Very funny! I like your
attitude!

* - He raises his left hand and thereto draws magical energy, which forms
a sphere. Ganondorf launches the sphere at Link, knocking him to the
ground upon impact.

Ganondorf : Pathetic little fool! Do you realize who you are dealing with?!
I am Ganondorf! And soon, I will rule the world!

* - He takes his leave.

* - Regarding the item in the water:

Navi      : What's that?

&lt;game&gt;    : You found the Ocarina of Time! This is the Royal Family's hidden
treasure which Zelda left behind. It glows with a mystical light...

* - Link hears Zelda's voice, and sees her image within the Temple of Time.

Zelda     : Link...can you hear me? It's me, Zelda...

Link, when you hold this Ocarina in your hand... I won't be around
anymore... I wanted to wait for you, but I couldn't delay any
longer... At least I could leave you the Ocarina and this melody...

This song opens the Door of Time...

&lt;game&gt;    : You've learned the Song of Time!

Zelda     : Now, Link. Play this melody in front of the altar in the Temple of
Time. You must protect the Triforce!

[003]     : Look at that guy--he's so scared! What a wimp! Ha ha ha!

[004]     : I almost got kicked by that black horse!

[005]     : What happened?!

[006]     : The one riding on the white horse holding the little girl...
Wasn't that a legendary Sheikah?

[007]     : I have a feeling something terrible is going to happen...
Maybe I should leave town soon.

[009]     : I might have seen a cute little girl around here... Maybe she went
to the castle? Who knows?

[010]     : Something happened in the castle! Kid, you'd better be careful!

[011]     : My precious little puppy's fur coat is very special compared to
the other mutts around here!

[012]     : Wasn't that Princess Zelda riding on the white horse?!

[015]     : That guy riding on the black horse must have been Ganondorf,
who is renowned as the Gerudo King of Thieves.

[016]     : Oh so scary... Oh so scary...

[017]     : That scary-looking man took off out of here really fast!

[018]     : We don't see a lot of Gerudos in these parts... Something fishy is
going on!

A soldier is lying on the ground.

[032]     : Unnngh...are you the boy from the forest...? I-I-I've finally met
you... I-I-I have something to t-t-tell you...

Ganondorf, the Gerudo King of Thieves, betrayed our King...
Zelda's nanny, Impa, sensed danger and escaped from the castle with
our Princess... I tried to stop Ganondorf's men from chasing them...
but...

The Princess was...waiting for a boy from the forest...that's you...
She wanted to give something to the boy... If you received it from
the Princess, hurry...to the Temple of Time....

&lt;game&gt;    : He's not moving anymore...

[033] ^   : This is a new type of bomb! It's available only in limited
quantities, and when I'm sold out, that's it!


Hyrule Castle  -  Social Script  


Guard 01  : There's a lot going on in the castle right now. I can't allow even
a dog to get into the castle!

* - Guards are positioned within the castle such that it is impossible for
Link to reach the courtyard.


Hyrule Castle Town  -  Temple of Time  


* - Near the Door of Time is a block on which words are inscribed.

&lt;game&gt;    : There are three hollows and an inscription here....

Ye who owns 3 Spiritual Stones
Stand with the Ocarina of Time
And play the Song of Time

That is how the inscription reads.

* - As Link plays the Song of Time, the Spiritual Stones rise into the air
and descend upon the hollows. An image of the Triforce placed on a wall
glows with golden light, prompting the door to open.

Beyond the Door of Time is a circular chamber that contains a platform
on which an image of the Triforce is surrounded by images of six medallions.
A sword has been driven into the platform at the Triforce's center.

Navi      : Link, isn't that...?! It's that legendary blade...The Master Sword!!

* - As Link grasps the sword by its hilt and pulls it from its resting place,
blue light engulfs the platform.

Ganondorf enters the chamber.

Ganondorf : Geh heh heh! Excellent work! As I thought, you held the keys to the
Door of Time! You have led me to the gates of the Sacred Realm...
Yes, I owe it all to you, kid!


Chamber of Sages  


Rauru     : Link... Wake up... Link, the chosen one...

* - From the perspective of his eyes, Link is seen awakening in a surreal area;
platforms made of water float in a room with walls of similar composition,
and no apparent floor or ceiling. On the central platform are six smaller
platforms that correspond to the Temple of Time's medallion images.

Aside from Link and Navi, only a man named "Rauru" is present.

Rauru     : I am Rauru, one of the ancient Sages...

Ages ago, we ancient Sages built the Temple of Time to protect
the entrance to the Sacred Realm... This is the Chamber of Sages,
inside the Temple of Light... The Temple of Light, situated in
the very center of the Sacred Realm, is the last stronghold against
Ganondorf's evil forces. The Master Sword--the evil-destroying sword
that you pulled out of the Pedestal of Time--was the final key to
the Sacred Realm.

Link... Don't be alarmed... Look at yourself...!

* - Link's form has changed into that of a young adult.

Navi      : Look Link! You're big now!! You've grown up!

Rauru     : The Master Sword is a sacred blade which evil ones may never
touch.... Only one worthy of the title of "Hero of Time" can pull it
from the Pedestal of Time....

However, you were too young to be the Hero of Time.... Therefore,
your spirit was sealed here for seven years. And now that you are
old enough, the time has come for you to awaken as the Hero of Time!

Well, do you understand your destiny?

-----------------------------------------------------------
-(Yes)
&lt;see below&gt;

-(No)
Rauru     : Right, it looks like you are confused... Let me tell you again,
from the beginning.

* - He repeats himself from "The Master Sword is".
-----------------------------------------------------------

Rauru     : But, remember... Though you opened the Door of Time in the name
of peace... Ganondorf, the Gerudo King of Thieves, used it to enter
this forbidden Sacred Realm! He obtained the Triforce from the
Temple of Light, and with its power, he became the King of Evil...

His evil power radiated from the temples of Hyrule, and in seven
short years, it transformed Hyrule into a world of monsters.
My power now has only little influence, even in this Sacred Realm...
Namely, this Chamber of Sages.

But there is still hope... The power of the Sages remains.
When the power of all the Sages is awakened... The Sages' Seals
will contain all the evil power in the void of the Realm...

I, Rauru, am one of the Sages... And... Your power to fight together
with the Sages makes you the Hero of Time! The Hero of Time, chosen
by the Master Sword!

Keep my spirit with you... And, find the power of the other Sages,
and add their might to your own!

* - A golden medallion descends from the air.

&lt;game&gt;    : You received the Light Medallion! Rauru the Sage adds his power
to yours!

Rauru     : Find the other Sages and save Hyrule!


Hyrule Castle Town  -  Temple of Time  


Navi      : Link...we're back in the Temple of Time... But have seven years
really passed?

It looks like you won't be able to use some of the weapons you found
as a kid anymore... Let's get out of here!

* - A person whose face is partially obscured by clothing suddenly appears near
the Pedestal of Time. Link draws his sword.

Sheik     : I've been waiting for you, Hero of Time...

When evil rules all, an awakening voice from the Sacred Realm will
call those destined to be Sages, who dwell in the five temples.

One in a deep forest...
One on a high mountain...
One under a vast lake...
One within the house of the dead...
One inside a goddess of the sand...

Together with the Hero of Time, the awakened ones will bind the evil
and return the light of peace to the world...

This is the legend of the temples passed down by my people,
the Sheikah. I am Sheik. Survivor of the Sheikahs...

As I see you standing there holding the mythical Master Sword,
you really do look like the legendary Hero of Time... If you believe
the legend, you have no choice. You must look for the five temples
and awaken the five Sages...

One Sage is waiting for the time of awakening in the Forest Temple.
The Sage is a girl I am sure you know... Because of the evil power
in the temple, she cannot hear the awakening call from the Sacred
Realm...

Unfortunately, equipped as you currently are, you cannot even enter
the temple... But, if you believe what I'm saying, you should head
to Kakariko Village...

Do you understand, Link?

* - When speaking to Sheik again:

Sheik     : To save the forest girl, you need another skill... Head to Kakariko
Village!

* - Inscription on the block near the Door of Time:

&lt;game&gt;    : The Ocarina of Time opened the
door. The Hero of Time, with the
Master Sword, descended here.


Building by gate  


* - This is where [002] had been. Now, a cloaked person with a stick is present.

[033]     : Oh...you are quite an energetic young man. You're brave and
handsome, too. Heh heh heh...your name is Link, isn't it. [sic]
Heh heh he...don't be surprised. I can read people's minds.

If I looked as good as you, I could run a different kind of
business...heh he heh...

My shop is the only Ghost Shop in Hyrule. Because of the great
Ganondorf, it is a fine time for a business like this...heh heh
heh... Oh...I can only hope the world gets even worse!

The ghosts, called Poes, are spirits of concentrated hatred that
appear in the fields and graveyard. They hate the world! Young man,
if you catch a Poe, I will pay a lot of money for it... Heh heh hee!

* - Subsequently:

[033]     : Hey, young man. What's happening today? If you have a Poe, I will
buy it. Your card now has 0 points. Come back again! Heh heh heh!

* - Upon presenting a Poe:

[033]     : Oh, you brought a Poe today!

........ Hmmm... This is a normal Poe. Here are your 10 Rupees.
Take them. Heh heh.

Hmmmm! Very interesting! This is a Big Poe! I'll buy it for 50
Rupees. On top of that, I'll put 100 points on your card. If you
earn 1,000 points, you'll be a happy man! Heh heh.

* - Upon earning 1,000 points:

[033]     : Wait a minute! WOW! You have earned 1,000 points! Young man, you are
a genuine Ghost Hunter! Is that what you expected me to say? Heh heh
heh! Because of you, I have extra inventory of Big Poes, so this
will be the last time I can buy a ghost.

You're thinking about what I promised would happen when you earned
1,000 points. Heh heh. Don't worry. I didn't forget. Just take this.

* - [033] provides an Empty Bottle.

* - Subsequently:

[033]     : Hey, young man. What's happening today? If you have a Poe, I will
buy it. Your card now has 1000 points. Come back again! Heh heh heh!

[CT-004]  : I tell you, I saw him! I saw the ghostly figure of Dampé the
gravekeeper sinking into his grave. It looked like he was holding
some kind of treasure!

[CT-006]  : A long time ago... There was a man in this very village who had an
eye they said could see the truth! Now usually, you have to train
your mind's eye most strenuously to actually see the truth...
But this fella, no, they say he had a different way of doing
things... His house stood where the well is now...

* - [CT-008]'s script has not changed.

without permission?! I want to talk to your parents!

Oh well. This isn't my house anyway. This is the great Impa's house!
The great Impa has gone to the graveyard to seal up the humongous
creature there. Since Ganondorf appeared, many monsters have been
sighted around here. Only the great Impa has kept peace in our
village. You have to remember that, young man!

Oh well. Speaking of the great Impa, she hasn't come back yet.
I wonder what happened to her? I heard that the ghost of the
gravekeeper often appears in the graveyard behind this village...
But, no big deal.

[KA-010]  : All people have hardships in their past that they would rather

I bet even someone like him has had his share of troubles in the
past...

[CT-011]  : Look at him...the man with the beard. I think he was fired from his
job at the ranch... He's always just lazing around, morning, noon
and night. He's an awfully carefree guy during such hard times...

Talon     : Z Z Z... Malon...doing all right... Mumble...mumble... Sorry to make

if you dare!

* - After having raced him through the grave:

Dampé     : The time of this race was &lt;""&gt;!!

Hehehe, young man... You were very quick to be able to keep up
with me! Hehehe! As a reward, I'm going to give you my treasure.
It's called the Hookshot! Its spring-loaded chain will pull you
to any spot where its hook sticks. Doesn't that sound cool?
I'm sure it will help you!

I live here now, so come back again sometime. I'll give you
something cool!

One more thing! Be careful on your way back! Heheheh...

* - A treasure chest appears.

&lt;game&gt;    : You found the Hookshot! It's a spring-loaded chain that you can
cast out to hook things. You can use it to drag distant items
toward you, or you can use it to pull yourself toward something.
While holding {C}, you can aim with {Control Stick}. Shoot it by
releasing {C}.

[02'14] ---        Lon Lon Ranch        --- [02'14] 




Part 01  


* - Malon is in the stable during the day.

Malon     : Oh...a visitor! It's been a long time since we've had a visitor
here... Where did you come from?

Since Ganondorf came, people in the Castle Town have gone,
places have been ruined, and monsters are wandering everywhere.
Mr. Ingo is just using the ranch to gain Ganondorf's favor...
Everyone seems to be turning evil...

But Dad... He was kicked out of the ranch by Mr. Ingo...
If I disobey Mr. Ingo, he will treat the horses so badly...
So... There's nothing I can do...

* - At night, she sings Epona's Song in the horses' corral.

Malon     : Please keep it a secret from Mr. Ingo that I sing this song...

* - At night, Ingo sleeps in the house's bedroom.

Ingo      : Z Z Z Z Z Z Z Z Z Z Z Z Z... S-stop that song...I...I...
Mumble... mumble...

* - During the day, Ingo stands outside of the corral.

Ingo      : There are some people in Kakariko spreading rumors that I cheated
Talon out of the ranch, but... Don't be ridiculous! That guy Talon
was weak! I, the hard-working Ingo, poured so much energy into this
place! I don't want any strangers like you saying anything bad
about me!

Listen. The great Ganondorf recognized my obvious talents and gave
the ranch to me! I will raise a fine horse and win recognition from
the great Ganondorf!

Say, young man, do you want to ride one of my fine horses? Pay me 10
Rupees and you can ride.

-----------------------------------------------------------
-(Ride)
Ingo      : Do you want to hear how to ride?

--(Listen)
Ingo      : Approach the horse quietly and stand by its side. Press {A} to mount
up. Use the {Control Stick} to make it run. Once it starts running,
press {A} to tap it with the whip. It will speed up! When you want
to jump over a fence, accelerate and hit it head on! If you try to
jump over a fence at an angle, the horse won't like it, and it won't
jump. After the horse comes to a complete stop, press {A} to
dismount. Now, have fun!

Thank you so much. Heh heh!

--(Don't listen)
Ingo      : Thank you so much. Heh heh!

-(Don't ride)
Ingo      : All right then, scram ya little punk!
-----------------------------------------------------------

* - While in the corral, when speaking to Ingo while on foot:

Ingo      : If you use {Z} Targeting, you can talk to me from horseback.
Are you ready to go home so soon?

-----------------------------------------------------------
-(No, I want to ride.)
Ingo      : Tsk tsk...When your time is up, I'll kick you out of here.

-(Yes, I'm done.)
* - The session concludes.
-----------------------------------------------------------

* - When speaking to Ingo while riding a horse:

Ingo      : When you want to dismount, stop and press {A}. Hey young man! Do I
know you? I just felt as though I've seen you somewhere before...

* - He recites the script that is used for speaking to him
while on foot.

* - Once one minute has passed:

Ingo      : Hey! Time's up, young man! You only paid 10 Rupees! You've played
around long enough!

* - When speaking to Ingo while riding a horse, on the second and subsequent
visits to the corral:

Ingo      : You're getting better! How about a little race with me? One lap
around the corral with that horse. Let's make a little wager,
say 50 Rupees?

-----------------------------------------------------------
-(Do it)
* - If Link's funds are insufficient, then Ingo says the same thing as when
"Don't do it" is selected.

If the funds are adequate, then the race begins.

-(Don't do it)
Ingo      : Hey hey... What's the matter? Don't you have even 50 Rupees?!
I don't want to race with someone so poor!
-----------------------------------------------------------

* - Upon losing the race:

Ingo      : Hee hee hee... Too bad for you! I get your 50 Rupees.

Heh heh... Are you mad because you lost? If you're that upset,
how about another race? Bet 50 Rupees and race again?

* - "Race" and "Don't race" produce the same results are the
previous agreement/refusal options.

* - Upon winning the race, which is only possible by riding Epona,
who must be called with Epona's Song:

Ingo      : Sh-shoooot! If the great Ganondorf found out about this
humiliation... Hey, you!! How about another race!  If you win...
You can keep...the horse!!

* - Upon losing the second race:

Ingo      : Wah ha hah! You're just a kid, after all! Well, come back any time
and we'll have some more fun...

* - He repeats the "Are you mad" script.

* - Upon winning the second race:

Ingo      : What's up with that horse?! Is that Epona? How did you tame that
wild horse right under my nose?! I was going to present that horse
to the great Ganondorf... But I bet it on the race and lost! Shooot!

Hah ha hah! As I promised, I'll give the horse to you... However...
I'll never let you leave this ranch!

* - He closes a gate.

Epona can leap some of the ranch's outer walls.


Part 02  


* - Ingo is outside.

Ingo      : Hi there, how are you? I am Ingo. I feel so honored to be allowed
to work here.

* - Malon is outside.

Malon     :{1} Thank you very much for the other day... I haven't even asked you
your name yet... ........ Really? Link! That's what I thought!
You're the fairy boy from the forest! That was years ago!
Do you remember me? You do? I was sure it was you because Epona
remembered you!

Oh, I have to tell you about Mr. Ingo... He was afraid that the
Evil King might find out that Epona had been taken away...
It really upset him! But one day, all of a sudden, he went back
to being a normal, nice person! Now my dad is coming back...
I can't believe it, but peace is returning to this ranch!

It's all because of you! I owe you so much! Thank you!
Thank you, Link!

{2} Epona looks great! It looks like you were able to tame her, too!
How about trying your skill with Epona on an obstacle course?
I'll time you for two laps. It's pretty challenging. If you miss
jumping a fence in the proper order, you'll fail. How about it?
Do you want to try?

* - "Don't do it" does not prompt any additional script.
"Let's go" prompts:

The current record is 50 seconds. First, try to beat this record!
If you can beat the record, I'll give you a present! Give it your
best shot, OK? All right, let's get started!

* - Failure:

You failed! You have to jump over all the fences!

Are you making sure to approach the fences head on? If you
approach at an angle, the horse won't jump! If you want to try
again, mount Epona and get ready!

* - Success:

One more lap!

Wow! Great! Your time was &lt;""&gt;! You and Epona make a great
team!

You did it! &lt;""&gt; is the new course record! I have to give you
a present to commemorate your new record! The present is a little
too heavy to give to you here, so I'll have it delivered to your
house. Bet you can't wait to see it! Hee hee!

* - Secondary and subsequent attempts, after agreeing to try
the challenge, without having beat the initial record:

The record so far is &lt;&gt; seconds. Your best time is &lt;""&gt;.
If you can beat the record, I'll give you a present.
Give it your best shot, OK? Let's get going!

* - Secondary and subsequent attempts, after agreeing to try
the challenge, with having beat the initial record:

Your best time is &lt;""&gt;! How fast can you go?! C'mon,
let's get started!

* - Failing to beat new records:

Well, your time was &lt;""&gt;. You have to train harder! Remember,
you don't need to accelerate to jump over low fences, but you do
need to go fast to jump the high fences!

* - After Talon returns (see 03'06):

During the day, Malon and Ingo are outside, while Talon is in the stable.
At night, Malon and Talon are outside, while Ingo sleeps in their house.

Malon     : Mr. Ingo... He must have been tempted by evil powers. He's not
really a bad person at all...

* - Dismounted, day:

How is Epona doing? If you play Epona's Song with your Ocarina,
she will surely come to you. Please come back to the ranch whenever
you want to train Epona!

Talon     : I'm gonna turn over a new leaf and work real hard from now on.

Ingo      :   * - Day:

Hi there, how are you? I am Ingo. I feel so honored to be allowed
to work here.

* - Night:

Z Z Z Z Z Z Z Z... Mumble... It's not easy to be a working man...



[02'15] ---        Kokiri Forest        --- [02'15] 



Though Link has aged, none of the Kokiri in the forest have changed in form.

* [001-006] are Kokiri whose designations hold no bearing to past script,
as their only unique visual aspect had been their locations.

* [007-011] and [014] do apply to past script, as their positions are unchanged.

* Two males are absent. Potential absentees: [001], [003], [004], and [006].

* [012] and [013] are not used in this section due to the two males' absence,
which renders these females' unidentifiable out of [001-006]'s females.

* [008] is absent.


Social Script  


[ Outside ]
* - No one is outside, as monsters have appeared.

[ Buildings ]
* - Mido's house:

[001]     : Why is that fairy following you around? You're not one of us!

[002]     : I see. You didn't have any problems entering the forest, mister...
Did the meanies out there bother you much? Before the Great Deku
Tree died, you wouldn't see things like that around here...
Since it's dangerous outside, I always stay inside my house.
But I'm bored to death in here!

-----
* - Saria's house:

[003]     : Have you been travelling around much, mister? Have you ever met
a boy named Link? Mido said that the Great Deku Tree withered
because that boy did something wrong to it... Only Saria defended
Link--until she left. Maybe we misunderstood...

-----
* - House of the Know-it-All Brothers:

[009]     : Since the Great Deku Tree withered...more meanies have been
appearing in the forest... I'm scared!

[010]     : Where's Saria? Do you know Saria, mister? That's weird... Where has
Mido gone during such an emergency?

[011]     : An evil wind is blowing from the direction of the Forest Temple.
Saria left, saying, "I have to do something about it!" The Forest
Temple is located in the Sacred Forest Meadow in the far side of
the Lost Woods.

-----
* - House of Twins:

[004]     : Haven't I seen you somewhere before, mister?

[005]     : Saria went to the Temple and hasn't come back...

-----
* - Kokiri Shop:

[006]     : Hi, mister! You can't use a Deku Shield! It's only for kids!

[007]     : You can buy arrows at a shop only if you have a bow. Have you got
one, mister?

[014] ^   : We sell shields, but not swords!



[02'16] ---          Lost Woods         --- [02'16] 



* - The carpenter's son is present in Area 03. For his script, refer to 03'06.

Mido is blocking a certain path in the woods.

Mido      : What are you? Though you wear Kokirish clothing, you can't fool me!
I promised Saria I would never let anybody go through here.

* - Upon playing Saria's Song:

Mido      : That melody?! Saria plays that song all the time! You...Do you know
Saria? That song... Saria taught that song only to her friends...
OK... I trust you.

When I see you... I don't know why, but I remember...him...


Sacred Forest Meadow  


* - Sheik jumps down from a wall as Link enters Saria's prior locale.

Sheik     : The flow of time is always cruel... Its speed seems different for
each person, but no one can change it... A thing that doesn't change
with time is a memory of younger days...

In order to come back here again, play the Minuet of Forest.

* - Sheik readies a harp.

Sheik     : Play the Minuet of Forest!

&lt;game&gt;    : You have learned the Minuet of Forest!

Sheik     : Link... I'll see you again...

* - Sheik throws a Deku Nut to the ground, and is no longer present by the time
that its light fades.


Forest Temple  


* - A certain room of the temple contains several identical paintings. As Link
turns to leave the room, Ganondorf seems to appear behind him, situated
on a horse. However, the figure removes its mask, revealing itself to be
"Evil Spirit from Beyond: Phantom Ganon". It rides its horse in and out of
the paintings, afterwards dismounting the horse and floating about the room.

Upon defeating Phantom Ganon, it floats to a circle of purple light in the
center of the room.

Ganondorf : Hey kid, you did quite well... It looks like you may be gaining
some slight skill... But you have defeated only my phantom...
When you fight the real me, it won't be so easy!

What a worthless creation that ghost was! I will banish it to
the gap between dimensions!!

* - Phantom Ganon disappears. A circle of light appears, which teleports Link
to the Chamber of the Sages.


Chamber of the Sages  


* - Saria appears before Link.

Saria     : Thank you... Because of you, I could awaken as a Sage...
I am Saria. The Sage of the Forest Temple...

I always believed that you would come. Because I know you...

No... You don't have to explain it to me... Because it is destiny
that you and I can't live in the same world.

I will stay here as the Forest Sage and help you... Now, please take
this Medallion...

&lt;game&gt;    : You received the Forest Medallion! Saria awakens as a Sage and adds
her power to yours!

Saria will always be...your friend...

* - Link is transported to the Great Deku Tree's Meadow.

Refer to 02'17; the remainder of this section concerns subsequent visits
to the Lost Woods.


Mido's locale  


Mido      : Oh...I see... Saria won't ever come back... But...I...I made a
promise to Saria... If Link came back, I would be sure to tell him
that Saria had been waiting for him... Because Saria...really...
liked...

Hey, you. If you see him somewhere, please let him know...
And also... I'm sorry for being mean to him. Tell him that, too.



[02'17] ---        Kokiri Forest        --- [02'17] 




Great Deku Tree's Meadow  


* - A new tree is beginning to grow, having just emerged from underground.
Link moves to take a closer look, and is knocked to the ground as it
grows several feet in a moment.

Deku Tree : Hi there! I'm the Deku Tree sprout! Because you and Saria broke the
curse on the Forest Temple, I can grow and flourish! Thanks a lot!

Hey, have you seen your old friends? None of them recognized you
with your grown-up body, did they? That's because the Kokiri never
grow up! Even after seven years, they're still kids!

You must be wondering why only you have grown up! Well, as you might
have already guessed, you are not a Kokiri! You are actually a
Hylian! I am happy to finally reveal this secret to you!

Some time ago, before the King of Hyrule unified this country,
there was a fierce war in our world. One day, to escape from the
fires of the war, a Hylian mother and her baby boy entered this
forbidden forest. The mother was gravely injured... Her only choice
was to entrust the child to the Deku Tree, the guardian spirit of
the forest.

The Deku Tree could sense that this was a child of destiny, whose
fare would affect the entire world, so he took him into the forest.
After the mother passed away, the baby was raised as a Kokiri.
And now, finally, the day of destiny has come!

You are a Hylian, and were always bound to leave this forest.
And now... You have learned your own destiny... So you know what
you must do... That's right... You must save the land of Hyrule!

Now, Link, break the curses on all of the Temples, and return peace
to Hyrule!!


Social Script  


* - The Kokiri have returned to their normal positions.

[ Outside ]
[001]     : Link... I wonder if he will come back...

[002]     : Now that the Deku Tree's sprout is growing in the Great Deku Tree's
meadow, the forest has returned to normal!

[003]     : Teach me to do some fancy fencing! All I've ever done is tap {B}
all my life!

[004]     : You're such a big, strong guy! I really want to be like you someday
even though I'll always be small.

[005]     : I still think you really look like somebody I've seen before,
mister.

[006]     : I feel like I've known you for a long time, mister!

[007]     : You can buy arrows at a shop only if you have a bow. Have you got
one, mister?

* - [008] is still not present.

[ Buildings ]
* - House of the Know-it-All Brothers:

[009]     : Somehow, a fair wind has begun to blow recently.

[010]     : I'm sure Link will return someday!

[011]     : Since a fairy wind started to blow, I'm sure Link will come back!

-----
* - House of Twins:

[012]     : I wonder if Saria will come back...

-----
* - Kokiri Shop:

[013]     : I'm sure Link will return someday!

[014] ^   : We sell shields, but not swords!



[02'18] ---      Hyrule Castle Town     --- [02'18] 




Temple of Time  


Sheik     : You destroyed the wicked creatures that haunted the temple and
awakened the Sage... But there are still other Sages who need
your help. In order to awaken all the other Sages, you must become
even more powerful.

You must travel over mountains...under water...and even through
time...

If you want to return to your original time, return the Master Sword
to the Pedestal of Time. By doing this, you will travel back in time
seven years...

The time will come when you will have to return here quickly...
I will teach this to you for when that time comes... The song to
return you to the Temple of Light... The Prelude of Light...

* - Sheik readies a harp.

Sheik     : Play the Prelude of Light!

&lt;game&gt;    : You have learned the Prelude of Light!

Sheik     : As long as you hold the Ocarina of Time and the Master Sword,
you hold time itself in your hands...

Link, we shall meet again!

* - Sheik tosses a Deku Nut to the ground, and leaves before its light fades.



[02'19] ---        Death Mountain       --- [02'19] 




Death Mountain Trail  


* - A gigantic Goron named "Biggoron" is present near the crater's entrance.

Biggoron  : My Brotherrrr... Opened a new storrrre... It's Medigoron's Blade
Storrrrrrrre... Howeverrrrr... I am beterrrrrr at making
bladesssssss, Hylian carpenterrrrrs praise me forrrrrr my
skillssssss. I'm not lyinnnnng...

* - For additional script concerning this character, see 03'06.


Goron City  


* - Most Gorons are absent.

Medigoron is present on the second level.    

Medigoron : I just completed a small weapon. How about it... How about buying
this knife for 200 Rupees?

-----------------------------------------------
-(Buy)
Nope, you don't have enough Rupees!

* - With sufficient funds, he provides the Giant's Knife.

How do you like the feel of it?

* - After some use, the sword breaks.

It looks like there is a problem with its durability... But still...
How about buying this knife for 200 Rupees?

-(Don't buy)
All right. Come back again.
-----------------------------------------------

* - Also on the second level is a small Goron rolling about. Upon stopping the
Goron via bombs:

Goron     : How could you do this to me? You, you're Ganondorf's servant!
Hear my name and tremble! I am Link! Hero of the Gorons!

What? Your name is also Link? Then you must be the legendary
Dodongo Buster and Hero, Link!

My dad is Darunia... Do you remember him? Dad named me Link after
you, because you're so brave! It's a cool name! I really like it!

Link, you're a hero of us Gorons! I'm so glad to meet you!
Please give me your autograph! Sign it: "To my friend, Link of the
Gorons"

Oh... I guess it's not a good time to ask you for this...
Please help everyone! My dad, Darunia, went to the Fire Temple.
A dragon is inside! If we don't hurry up, even my dad will be eaten
by the dragon!! B-b-b-boooo hooooo!

&lt;game&gt;    : You'd better try to calm him down if you can... Maybe he will calm
down if you talk to him? What do you want to ask him?

-----------------------------------------------------------
-(About the dragon)
Link      : A long time ago there was an evil dragon named Volvagia living in
this mountain. That dragon was very scary! He ate Gorons! Using a
huge hammer, the hero of the Gorons... BOOOM! Destroyed it just like
that. This is a myth from long ago, but it's true! I know, because
my dad is a descendant of the hero! B-b-b-boooo hooooo!

-(About the Gorons)
* - If this is selected before "About the dragon", then:

Link      : B-b-b-boooo hooooo!

* - After the other option:

Link      : Everybody was taken to the Fire Temple... While my dad was out...
Ganondorf's followers came and took them all away! All of them
will be eaten by Volvagia!

Dad said that Ganondorf has revived Volvagia... As a warning to
those who might oppose him, Ganondorf is going to feed them all
to Volvagia!
-----------------------------------------------------------

* - After having selected both of the options:

Link      : Dad went to the Fire Temple all by himself to try to save
everyone... Please help, Link! I'll give you this heat-resistant
tunic!

&lt;game&gt;    : You got a Goron Tunic! This heat-resistant tunic is adult size,
so it won't fit a kid... Going to a hot place? No worry!

* - The doors to Darunia's chamber and the Goron Shop are opened.

Link      : Dad told me not to let anybody follow him to the temple, but...
Only you, Link, can save everyone! I'm sure that the shop owner,
who is hiding somewhere right now, will also help you!

Now, I'll tell you about the secret passage to the Fire Temple!
Try to move the statue inside Dad's room!


Goron City  -  Social Script  


[007] ^   : Oh, no! Everybody's gone! Only I was left behind!


Death Mountain Crater  


* - The statue of a Goron in Darunia's chamber blocks a path to the crater.
As Link crosses a partially-broken suspension bridge, Sheik jumps into
the area from a higher level.

Sheik     : It is something that grows over time... a true friendship. A feeling
in the heart that becomes even stronger over time... The passion of
friendship will soon blossom into a righteous power and through it,
you will know which way to go... This song is dedicated to the power
of the heart... Listen to the Bolero of Fire...

* - Sheik readies a harp.

Sheik     : Play the Bolero of Fire!

&lt;game&gt;    : You have learned the Bolero of Fire!

Sheik     : Link... I'll see you again...

* - Link tries to approach Sheik, but is blocked by a wall of fire.
Sheik then uses a Deku Nut to obscure vision and depart.


Fire Temple  


* - Link quickly encounters Darunia by the locked door to Volvagia's locale.

Darunia   : Who's there?  Is that you, Link...? Oh, it really is Link!
You've grown so big since I last saw you!

I want to have a man-to-man talk with you, but now's not the time.
Ganondorf is causing trouble on Death Mountain again! He has revived
the evil, ancient dragon Volvagia! On top of that, he is going to
feed my people to that evil dragon as a warning to other races that
might resist him...

If that fire-breathing dragon escapes from the mountain, all of
Hyrule will become a burning wasteland! I will go on ahead to try
to seal up the evil dragon... I'm concerned, though, because I don't
have the legendary hammer... But I have no choice.

Link...I'm asking you to do this as my Sworn Brother... While I'm
trying to deal with the dragon, please save my people!
The prisoners' cells are in the opposite direction. I'm counting on
you, Link!

* - He enters Volvagia's chamber. The lock is reset once the door closes.

* - The Gorons, each placed in different cells, are curled up into balls.

Gorons    : Please...Don't...Eat me... If you eat something like me, you'll get
a stomach ache! You'll be very sorry!!

* - After opening a Goron's cage:

Gorons    : Are you releasing me? Am I free to go?

{1} I'll tell you a secret for saving me! In order to get into the
room where Darunia went, you have to do something about the
pillar stuck in the ceiling. Find a path that leads to a room
above the ceiling right away!

{2} Here's a secret for saving me! A wall that you can destroy with
the Goron's "special crop" will sound different than a regular
wall if you hit it with your sword.

{3} I'll tell you a secret for saving me! There are switches in this
temple that you have to cut to activate. But, you can also use
the Goron "special crop" to do the job.

{4} I'll tell you a secret for saving me! In this temple, there are
doors that fall down when you try to open them. When one of these
doors starts to fall, move! If you use a sample of the Goron's
"special crop," you can break it...

{5} Let me tell you a secret as a reward for releasing me! When you
are on fire, you can put it out by swinging your sword, or by
rolling forward... Did you know that?

{6} Here's a tip for rescuing me! Somewhere in this temple, you're
sure to meet up with some creatures that dance as they attack.
Arrows won't hurt them! Looks like you might need some of the
Goron's "special crop!" That's all I have to tell you!

{7} I'll tell you a secret for saving me! If you find a place you
can see on the map, but can't reach, try playing your Ocarina!

{8} I'll tell you a secret for saving me! A door is hidden inside
the statue at the entrance to this temple. But, the Goron
"special crop" won't work on it... Don't you have anything
stronger?

{9} Oh, I see. Big Brother Darunia asked you to rescue me. I owe you
big time! Please help Big Brother!

* - The Gorons leave the temple after Link speaks to them.

* - In the room that Darunia had entered, there is a lava-surrounded platform
on which there are nine holes, each filled with lava. "Subterranean Lava
Dragon: Volvagia" flies in and out of the holes.

Upon the enemy's defeat, its skin burns off and its skeleton falls apart.
A circle of light appears, which teleports Link to the Chamber of the Sages.

From Kakariko Village, [KA-007] observes the Death Mountain volcano erupt,
after which the clouds around the volcano return to normal.


Chamber of the Sages  


* - Darunia appears before Link.

Darunia   : Thank you, Brother! I really appreciate what you did. I thank you
on behalf of the entire Goron race! You turned out to be a real man,
just as I thought you would!

By the way, I, the wild Darunia, turned out to be the great Sage of
Fire... Isn't that funny, Brother? Well, this must be what they call
destiny. Nothing has made me happier than helping you seal the evil
here!

Hey, Brother, take this! This is a Medallion that contains the
power of the fire spirits--and my friendship.

&lt;game&gt;    : You received the Fire Medallion! Darunia awakens as a Sage
and adds his power to yours!

Darunia   : Don't forget... Now you and I are true Brothers!


Goron City  -  Social Script  


Link      : Brother Link! Everybody has come back! Dad and you destroyed the
dragon together, didn't you! When I grow up, I want to be a strong
man like you, Link!

[1-2, 4-6]: Thank you, Link!!

* - [003] is not present.

[007] ^   : Everybody has come back! It's business as usual!



[02'20] ---        Zora's Domain        --- [02'20] 




Zora's Domain  


* - The domain has been frozen. King Zora is frozen in red ice; no other Zoras
appear to be present.

Bottled Blue Fire can be used to thaw the ice surrounding King Zora.

King Zora : Oh--I've come back to life! Was it you who saved me? Don't be
nervous!

It looks like you have a hard time breathing underwater.
As an expression of my gratitude, I grant you this tunic.
With this, you won't choke underwater.

&lt;game&gt;    : You got a Zora Tunic! This diving suit is adult size, so it won't
fit a kid. Wear it, and you won't drown underwater.

* - Alternatively, if Link already possesses a Zora Tunic:

King Zora : Ohhh, I'm revived... Was it you who saved me? Don't be so nervous!
I will give you a Zora Tunic as a token of my thanks. If you have
this, you can... What?! You already have one? You're ready for
anything, aren't you?

With my heartfelt thanks...how about a KISS?! What? You don't want
it?! Oh well... If you don't want my rewards, you can listen to my
troubles...

Princess Ruto has gone to Lake Hylia and has not come back...
I'm worried...again!

* - Regardless of having received a tunic, when speaking to him again:

King Zora : Oh, my dear, sweet Princess Ruto... Where has she gone?
I'm so worried...

* - The Zora Shop's entrance can also be unfrozen via Blue Fire.

[008] ^   : You say you want to buy a Zora Tunic? That tunic is made of the
finest material, and is therefore exceedingly expensive! In fact,
I'm afraid only that very rich family in Kakariko Village can afford
this fine garment...


Zora's Fountain  


* - The fountain has not been entirely frozen, although there is snow,
and icebergs float in the waters. Jabu-Jabu is absent.

By jumping across the icebergs, Link can access:


Ice Cavern  


* - Sheik appears after Link acquires the Iron Boots from a treasure chest.

Sheik     : We meet again, Link...

If you came here to meet the Zoras, you wasted your time... This is
all there is... With one exception, the Zoras are now sealed under
this thick ice sheet... I managed to rescue the Zora princess from
under the ice, but...she left to head for the Water Temple...

This ice is created by an evil curse... The monster in the Water
Temple is the source of the curse. Unless you shut off the source,
this ice will never melt.... If you have courage enough to confront
the danger and save the Zoras, I will teach you the melody that
leads to the temple.

Time passes, people move... Like a river's flow, it never ends...
A childish mind will turn to noble ambition... Young love will
become deep affection... The clear water's surface reflects
growth... Now listen to the Serenade of Water to reflect upon
yourself....

* - Sheik readies a harp.

Sheik     : Play the Serenade of Water!

&lt;game&gt;    : You have learned the Serenade of Water!

Sheik     : Link... I'll see you again...

* - Link tries to approach Sheik, but is unable to do so before Sheik uses a
Deku Nut to escape.


Zora's Domain  


King Zora : Ah, I see... Princess Ruto went to the Water Temple...

[ Outside ]
* - Pierre is not present.

Bonooru   : I am Bonooru, the scarecrow musical genius! I hear a song once,
and I never forget it, baby!

* - If a song was played for Bonooru in the past:

Hey! Aren't you the fairy buddy I met a long time ago? Wow,
you grew, dude!

Well, here's your song... What? No, I never forget! You, you're the
one who forgot...aren't you? If you have an Ocarina, play that song,
baby!

* - Upon taking out the ocarina:

Hey, it's the Ocarina! Play that song with it, baby!

* - Failure:

Play it like that and you'll never move this scarecrow's heart,
baby!

* - Success:

OH YEAHHH!! That's it, that's the tune!! You rock!! I'm blown away!
Oh, no, no! I didn't forget the song...I never forget anything!
But I just feel like rewarding you, baby!

........ I have a good idea! My buddy Pierre is wandering around,
so play that tune when you want to call him! I'll tell him to help
you if he's nearby and hears that song, baby!

* - Speaking to Bonooru again:

Play the usual tune to call Pierre! If he's nearby, he'll come out
to help you, baby!

[ Lakeside Laboratory ]
* - [002]'s script is the same as previously, until--via the Gold Scale gained
from the Fishing Pond--Link dives deeper than he could in the past.

[002]     : You may not have noticed, but I've been watching you. You dove
&lt;6/7&gt; meters just now. You should be able to dive deeper!

You may not have noticed, but I've been watching you. You touched
the bottom just now.  Fantastic! I'll give this to you!

* - He provides a Piece of Heart for diving eight meters.

Upon subsequent eight-meter dives:

Your diving is the best in the world. Why don't you dive to the
bottom of Lake Hylia?

[ Fishing Pond ]
* - [003] is now wearing a hat. If the fishing pond was not visited in the past,
then the first of the following paragraphs is omitted.

[003]     : Hey, mister! I remember you! It's been a long time! How many years
has it been? Seven years?! What have you been doing all this time?!
You're my only customer. I'm almost out of business! Seriously!
On top of that, my hair... Uh, I mean, never mind...

Well, do you want to go fishing? It costs only 20 Rupees!

* - The remainder of this script is unchanged.

* - While fishing:

[003]     : Oh my gosh! This fish is gigantic!! A fish this big can't even fit
on the screen, and I can't weigh it accurately, but it looks like
it's about &lt;&gt; pounds!! You'll want to keep this one, right?

* - "Keep it"
"Don't keep it"

Gosh! That's a strange fish you caught there! On top of that,
it weighs &lt;&gt; pounds! What do you want to do with it?

* - "Keep it anyway"
"I don't want it"

Note: This is the Hyrule Loach.

* - After having paid to fish:

[003]     : What do you want?

-----------------------------------------------
-(Weigh my fish.)
* - New prizes: Red Rupee, Purple Rupee, Golden Scale.

WOW! What a rare fish! This is a Hyrule Loach! For this fish,
size doesn't matter. I'll give you this prize!

* - He provides a Purple Rupee, or (assumed) the Golden Scale.

Recently, the number of these fish has decreased tremendously,
so I'm going to release this one.

-(Let's talk about something.)
* - This is unchanged.

-(I want to quit.)
* - If no fish have been caught:

Passion alone won't catch you many fish. I'm serious!

* - If at least one fish has been caught, then he says nothing.
-----------------------------------------------

* - Upon catching [003]'s hat with the fishing hook:

[003]     : What? What are you doing to me?!

Hey, what are you doing? I told you not to do that! You're terrible!
Seriously! Give me back my hat!

-----------------------------------------------
-(OK)
You're a kind-hearted kid! But don't tell anyone about this.
Seriously!

-(No way)
* - Nothing more is said.
-----------------------------------------------

* - Sinking Lure:

&lt;game&gt;    : Wow! Is this what I think it is? Astonishing! You snagged a
sinking lure! What do you want to do with it?

* - "Use it now."
"Get rid of it."

[003]     :   * - "Let's talk about something.":

What? Do you want to fish with a different lure? ...Hey, what's
that? What? You just picked it up? Usually, the rules says [sic]
you can't use one of those. I mean, usually. But, what the heck...

* - "Weigh my fish.":

YAHOOOOOO! This is HUGE!! A new record!! This...this weighs as much
as... &lt;&gt; pounds!! Buuuuuuuut! That sinking lure is in violation of
the rules! So, no prize for you. Wah ha ha ha ha ha!

Tank      : The biggest fish ever caught in this pond weighed &lt;&gt; pounds.
The angler: Link
(NOTE: With illegal sinking lure.)


Water Temple  


* - In a certain room:

Ruto      : Oh...you... If I'm right...Link?! You're Link, aren't you?
It's me, your fiancée, Ruto! Princess of the Zoras!

* - Link seems a touch startled.

Ruto      : I never forgot the vows we made to each other seven years ago!
You're a terrible man to have kept me waiting for these seven
long years...

But now is not the time to talk about love... I'm sure you've
already seen it! Zora's Domain--totally frozen! A young man named
Sheik saved me from under the ice... But my father and the other
Zoras have not...yet... I want to save them all! I want to save
Zora's Domain!

You! You have to help me! This is a request from me, the woman who
is going to be your wife! Link, you have to help me destroy the evil
monster in the Temple, OK?!

Inside the Water Temple, there are three places where you can change
the water level. I'll lead the way. Follow me, quickly!!

* - Plaques are placed throughout the temple's walls.

Plaque 01 : Those who wish to open the path sleeping at the bottom of the lake
must play the song passed down by the Royal Family.

Plaque 2-3: Those who wish to open the gate on the far heights, play the song
passed down by the Royal Family.

* - A certain room of the temple does not appear to have any walls or ceiling;
the wall-like structures to which the room's two doors are attached
merely stand atop mounds of sand. Between said doors, which are on opposite
sides of the area, there is a dead tree. Knee-high water flows for as far
as can be seen, given the fog that starkly limits vision.

The second of the doors is blocked by metal bars. As Link heads away from
the locked door, a being similar to himself--Dark Link--materializes by the
tree. Dark Link initiates combat, during which it predicts Link's moves.

Once Dark Link is defeated, the tree disappears, and the walls and ceiling
emerge from the fog.

* - In the final room, four platforms reside in a pool of water.

Navi      : Link! Look out! That isn't normal water over there!

* - "Giant Aquatic Amoeba: Morpha" appears. Morpha is able to control the water
so as to move itself about, and also to attack, such as by forming tentacles
with the water.

Upon its defeat, Morpha explodes. The water rises to the ceiling through a
single tentacle, spreads out, and evaporates. What remains drops to the
ground and splatters, prompting a circle of light to appear.

The light takes Link to:


Chamber of the Sages  


* - Ruto appears before Link.

Ruto      : Link... I would have expected no less from the man I chose to be
my husband. Zora's Domain and its people will eventually return to
their original state.

As a reward... I grant my eternal love to you.

Well, that's what I want to say, but I don't think I can offer that
now. I have to guard the Water Temple as the Sage of Water...
And you... You're searching for the princess, Zelda? Hah! You can't
hide anything from me!

Princess Zelda... She's alive. I can sense it...so don't be
discouraged.

I can tell that nothing will stop you in your quest for justice
and peace... You must take this Medallion... Take it respectfully!

&lt;game&gt;    : You received the Water Medallion! Ruto awakens as a Sage and adds
her power to yours!

Ruto      : If you see Sheik, please give him my thanks, OK?


Lake Hylia  


* - Sheik is standing on a small isle. The lake's water begins to rise.

Sheik     : As the water rises, the evil is vanishing from the lake...
Link, you did it!

* - Link is teleported to Sheik's locale.

Sheik     : Did Ruto want to thank me? I see.... We have to return peace to
Hyrule for her sake, too. Don't we?

Look at that, Link... Together, you and Princess Ruto destroyed
the evil monster! Once again, the lake is filled with pure water.
All is as it was here.

* - Link steps to the isle's edge and examines the lake. While he does so,
Sheik observes him.

Sheik walks away while Link is looking at the lake; though Link soon
realizes this, Sheik first reaches the top of a nearby tree. As Link
looks about, Sheik jumps off of the tree and dives into the lake.


Lake Hylia  -  Social Script  


* - On the isle, there is writing on a stone.

Writing   : When water fills the lake, shoot for the morning light.

* - Firing at arrow in the sun's direction causes the Fire Arrow to appear.


Zora's Domain  


* - Zora's Domain is still frozen, though the weather is no longer snowy.
King Zora's script is unchanged.



[02'22] ---      Kakariko Village       --- [02'22] 



* - Impa's house and the House of Skulltula have been set ablaze.
Link approaches Sheik, who is standing by the well.

Sheik     : Get back, Link!

* - The wooden poles attached to the well are severed and tossed aside
by an invisible force. Rain begins to fall.

An invisible spirit emerges from the well, by which Sheik is grabbed and
thrown to the ground. The spirit moves about the village, appearing as
large bluish lines on the ground and walls of buildings.

Link draws his sword; the screen goes blank. Sounds made would suggest
that he is attacked harshly.

Later, Link awakens on the ground, Sheik beside him. The fires have ceased.

Sheik     : Looks like you're coming around...

Link.... A terrible thing has happened! The evil shadow spirit has
been released! Impa, the leader of Kakariko Village, had sealed the
evil shadow spirit in the bottom of the well.... But the force of
the evil spirit got so strong, the seal of the well broke, and it
escaped into the world!!

I believe Impa has gone to the Shadow Temple to seal it again,
but...she will be in danger without any help! Link! Impa is one of
the six Sages. Destroy the evil shadow spirit and save Impa!

There is an entrance to the Shadow Temple beneath the graveyard
behind this village. The only thing I can do for you is teach you
the melody that will lead you to the Shadow Temple... This is the
melody that will draw you into the infinite darkness that absorbs
even time... Listen to this, the Nocturne of Shadow!!

* - Sheik readies a harp.

Sheik     : Play the Nocturne of Shadow!

&lt;game&gt;    : You have learned the Nocturne of Shadow!

Sheik     : Let me take care of the village! I'm counting on you, Link!

* - Sheik disappears under the veil of a Deku Nut's light.


Social Script  -  Nighttime  


[ Buildings ]
[CT-003]  : Wah hah hah hah hah hah! When times are tough, laughter is the best
medicine! That's what my dad always said!


Windmill  


[KA-020]  : Grrrrrrrrr! I'll never forget what happened on that day, seven years
ago! Grrrrrrrrr! It's all that Ocarina kid's fault! Next time he
comes here, I'm gonna mess him up!

* - Upon taking out the Ocarina of Time:

[KA-020]  : What?! You've got an ocarina!! What the heck! That reminds me of
that time, seven years ago! Back then a mean kid came here and
played a strange song. It messed up this windmill!

I'll never forget this song!

&lt;game&gt;    : You've learned the Song of Storms!

* - The Song of Storms creates a rainstorm within the windmill, and causes
the central platform to rotate faster than it had before.

[KA-020]  : Oh, no! A storm again!! You played the Ocarina again, didn't you!!
Grrrrrrrrrrrrrrr!!

* - In the past, upon playing the Song of Storms:

As the windmill spins faster, the water's well is drained.

[KA-020]  : Go around, go around, go around... What? It's going way too fast!


Bottom of the Well  


* - The Lens of Truth is located in the well, guarded by Dead Hand--
a somewhat-humanoid being with no apparent legs, which controls four long
arms that protrude from the ground, aside from its regular arms with blade-
like hands.


Graveyard  


* - The Nocturne of Shadow transports Link to a previously-inaccessible area.
A descending staircase leads to a room with one door on which an image of
an eye is printed, and before which numerous torches surround a platform.

By using Din's Fire to simultaneously light all of the torches,
the door is prompted to slide out of the way.

The doorway leads to:


Shadow Temple  


* - Upon approaching certain walls, messages are displayed.

Message 01: The Shadow will yield only to one with the eye of truth, handed down
in Kakariko Village.

Message 02: One who gains the eye of truth will be able to see what is hidden
in the darkness.

Message 03: Shadow Temple... Here is gathered Hyrule's bloody history of greed
and hatred...

Message 04: What is hidden in the darkness... Tricks full of ill will...
You can't see the way forward...

* - There is a deep chasm in the temple's second room, across which a statue of
a large face has been fastened to a wall, along with two stone hands and a
platform in the shape of a tongue. At the statue's mouth is a pathway,
which is blocked via gate.

Sign 01   : Only one who has sacred feet can cross the valley of the dead.

* - The Hover Boots are obtained by defeating a Dead Hand elsewhere in the
temple.

In the room with the chasm, there is a statue of a bird.

Statue    : Make my break face the skull of truth. The alternative is descent
into the deep darkness.

* - The statue must be rotated to face a certain skull atop a stick, which is
the skull that does not disappear when viewed through the Lens of Truth.

Failure causes the floor around the statue--which is held by hinges--
to open, dropping Link into a pit. Success opens the gate across the chasm.

* - In a room with two rising and falling platforms, on the undersides of which
there are spikes:

Sign 02   : Only one with the eye of truth will find the stone umbrella that
protects against the rain of blades.

* - The Lens of Truth reveals an alcove housing a large stone block.

* - A hole in one room's floor leads Link to a circular chamber with a bongo-
like platform, which is surrounded by toxic fluid.

The bongo-esque platform is beat by two large, disembodied hands. The hands
belong to "Phantom Shadow Beast: Bongo Bongo", which takes the form of the
upper body of a humanoid figure, though it possesses only one eye.

Upon its defeat, Bongo Bongo dissolves into the bongo. A circle of light
appears, which teleports Link to:


Chamber of the Sages  


* - Impa appears before Link.

Impa      : The boy with the noble Zelda's Ocarina...As I expected, you have
come. I am Impa, one of the Sheikah. I am Princess Zelda's
caretaker, and I am also the Sage who guards the Shadow Temple.

We Sheikah have served the royalty of Hyrule from generation to
generation as attendants. However... On that day seven years ago,
Ganondorf suddenly attacked...and Hyrule Castle surrendered after
a short time. Ganondorf's target was one of the keys to the Sacred
Realm...the hidden treasure of the Royal Family...The Ocarina of
Time!

My duty bound me to take Zelda out of Ganondorf's reach. When last
I saw you, as we made our escape from the castle, you were just a
lad... Now I see that you have become a fine hero...

There's nothing to worry about... The Princess is safe now. Soon,
you'll meet Princess Zelda face-to-face, and she will explain
everything... That is when we, the Six Wise Ones, will seal up
the Evil King and return peace to Hyrule.

I have to stay here... You go to Princess Zelda's side and protect
her on my behalf. Now I put my power, which should be helpful to
you, into this Medallion!

&lt;game&gt;    : You received the Shadow Medallion! Impa awakens as a Sage and adds
her power to yours!

Impa      : Please look out for the Princess!



[02'23] ---   Gerudo Valley/Fortress    --- [02'23] 




Gerudo Valley  -  Past  


* - A single bridge connects the two sides of the valley. Below the bridge is
a river that connects to Lake Hylia, fed by a waterfall at the end of a
stream flowing from Zora's Domain.

One side of the bridge is blocked by a gate, near which a Gerudo is present.

Gerudo 1  : The Gerudo's Fortress is located beyond this gate. A kid like you
has no business there.

* - Another Gerudo is present near the bottom of the waterfall, by a cow.

Gerudo 2  : Why did you come all the way down here? What? You were just about to
ask me the same thing? Well, now that you're down here, you may as
well make the best of things!


Gerudo Valley  -  Future  


* - The bridge across the valley is currently broken. Epona and the Longshot
are both viable methods of crossing.

Sign 01   : No Diving Allowed
--It won't do you any good!

Crptr Boss: I am a master craftsman. Those Gerudo thieves...they broke the
bridge. I want to fix it, but all of my workers are gone! They said
working as carpenters isn't cool, and they went to the Gerudo's
Fortress to become thieves...

Hey, you! If you're going to the fortress, would you mind finding
out what my workers are doing over there?

* - A man who had run about Hyrule Field in the past (see 03'04) is present
inside of a tent.

RunningMan: I'm the wandering running man! I've run all over this land in search
of competitors who have a true killer instinct! I came here to run
through the Haunted Wasteland, but it doesn't look like good timing
for that.

Though I want to go back to Hyrule Field, the bridge is...well,
you can see it from here. So I'm stuck here, inside this tent.
I don't think I can accept your challenge right now. Heh heh!


Gerudo's Fortress  


* - If Link is spotted by any of the fortress's many guards:

Guard     : Halt! Stay where you are!

* - He is deposited in a jail.

Guard     : Stupid Kid [sic]! Get in there and keep quiet!

[ Fortress interior  -  Carpenters ]
* - The carpenters have each been placed into cells.

Carpenters: Hey, you! Young man, over there! Look over here, inside the cell!

I have no idea where you come from, but you must have a lot of guts
to make it past all the guards around here!

All of my fellow carpenters are imprisoned somewhere in here. If you
can get us out of here, we'll repay the favor somehow! But be
careful! There's sure to be Gerudo guards somewhere around here....

Woo! Watch out!

* - A Gerudo Thief appears.

If Link is hit by a certain attack, he is imprisoned.

Thief     : Don't take us so lightly!

* - Upon the thief's defeat, she drops a Small Key and flees.

1st Saved : Did you come here to save me? Oh, that's just swell! I'm &lt;name&gt;
the carpenter. We were really interested in joining their all-female
group, but they locked us up like this just because we're men!

We don't care about the Gerudo anymore! They're so rude!

Three of my fellows have also been captured, so please help them
escape, too!

2nd Saved : You're a cute kid! Thank you for coming to save me! I'm &lt;name&gt;, the
carpenter. These women are so scary! I'd rather work as a carpenter.
than join them! I can't wait to say good-bye to this place!

Two of my buddies are still being held prisoner. Will you please
get them out, too?

3rd Saved : Thanks, boy! You're fantastic! I'm &lt;name&gt;, the carpenter. Have you
seen our boss, boy? He's probably worried about me! I have to get
back to him immediately!

One more of our workers is still a prisoner. Please save him!

4th Saved : I was afraid you were going to forget about me! Now I'm free!
Thanks! I'm &lt;name&gt; the carpenter.

For rescuing me, I'll tell you something interesting about the
desert that I overheard the Gerudos talking about. They said,
"In order to cross the Haunted Wasteland, you'll need the 'eye of
truth.' The Colossus is on the far side of the wasteland..."

OK, now I'm going back to my tent near Gerudo Valley, so, drop by
sometime. You may find something helpful there! Byeee!

* - As the final carpenter leaves, a Gerudo enters the room.

Gerudo    : I've seen your fine work. To get past the guards here, you must have
good thieving skills. I used to think that all men, besides the
great Ganondorf, were useless...but now that I've seen you, I don't
think so anymore!

The exalted Nabooru, our leader, put me in charge of this fortress.
Nabooru is the second-in-command to the great Ganondorf, King of the
Gerudo Thieves. Her headquarters are in the Spirit Temple, which is
at the end of the desert.

Say, you must want to become one of us, eh? All right, then!
You're in from now on!

Take this. With it, you will have free access to all areas of the
fortress.

&lt;game&gt;    : You obtained the Gerudo's Membership Card! You can get into the
Gerudo's training ground in their hideout.

Gerudo    : From now on, you're free to come and go as you please through the
gate to the desert. You'll find the Spirit Temple, where the
exalted Nabooru lives, out there in the desert.


Social Script  


[ Gerudo Valley ]
* - The bridge has been repaired.

Crptr Boss: Hey, I heard you saved my men. When they returned, we built this
bridge. Look at this! Isn't it a fine bridge? They may be wimpy
carpenters, but once they all got together, they got the job done.

Jiro      : In Gerudo society, those who have great skill in horseback riding
and archery are well respected. How about trying horseback archery
at the Gerudo's Fortress? If you have a horse, a Gerudo from the
fortress will set up your challenge.

Sabooru   : When Nabooru was a lone wolf thief, she never stole from the weak,
but... Now, Nabooru's gang of thieves stands for cruelty and
brutality. She claims to be a chivalrous robber, but...no way!

Ichiro    : The leader of the gang of thieves is Nabooru. She is experimenting
in brainwashing many people at the ruins in the desert.

Shiro     : Building a bridge over the valley is a simple task for four
carpenters.

* - When speaking to RunningMan, when the timer for another event is active:

RunningMan: Heh heh. You're already in the middle of something, aren't you.
If you want to challenge me, you have to come here with a clear
mind. No other distractions!

* - When speaking to RunningMan, when no timers are active:

RunningMan: I'm the wandering running man! I've run all over this land in search
of true competitve spirit. I beat all my challengers, man and beast.

You're an athletic guy, and you look like you have have a true
killer instinct, too. Now that the bridge over Gerudo Valley is
complete, I'm looking for a challenger to have a commemorative race
against. The best time to go from here to the bridge in the Lost
Woods was 02"38".  That's my record.

Will you challenge my record?

-----------------------------------------------
-(Yes)
Excellent! Then... You go first. I'll give you a headstart.
Now! Go ahead.

* - When speaking to him inside of the tent:

Heh heh heh. Please. Go ahead.

* - Upon playing warp music on the ocarina:

Oh, looks like you quit the race. Heh heh heh. I bet you had almost
rediscovered your killer instinct!

* - At the Lost Woods, having not beat his record:

Heh heh. You don't have enough killer instinct yet. Just train
harder. Good-bye, then!

* - At the Lost Woods, having beat his record:

Huff...puff...huff... Huff...huff...whew! You did quite well!
But you couldn't beat me! Your time was &lt;""&gt;, but I just beat
you by one second! Huff...huff... You'll have to challenge me again
sometime! Huff...huff... Good-bye, then!

* - In the tent (the first paragraph is omitted if his original
record was not beaten):

Well, not perfect, but you have some guts! Unfortunately, you never
can beat me. Your record is a thing of the past. Your time was
&lt;""&gt;, wasn't it? That was close, but I beat you by one second!

The best time to go from here to the bridge in the Lost Woods was
&lt;""&gt;.  That's my record. Will you challenge my record?

-(No)
Heh heh heh. You'll never discover your killer instinct with that
kind of attitude.

Writing   : One with the eye of truth shall be guided to the Spirit Temple by
an inviting ghost.

* - The Lens of Truth reveals a Poe floating above the building.

Poe       : I'll be your guide on the way, but coming back, I won't play!
I'll show you the only way to go, so follow me and don't be slow!

* - The Poe leads Link to:


Desert Colossus  -  Future  


* - Part of a mountain has been carved into the likeness of Nabooru's image.
The interior of the mountain has been made into the Spirit Temple.

Little can be done in the temple at the moment; one passage is too small
for Link to crawl through it, and the other pathway is obstructed by a block
which is too heavy for Link to move.

There is writing on two statues of cobras.

Writing 01: If you want to proceed to the past, you should return here with
the pure heart of a child.

Writing 02: If you want to travel to the future, you should return here with
the power of silver from the past.

* - Upon exiting the temple, Sheik jumps down from a tall stone structure.

Sheik     : Past, present, future...

* - Kaepora Gaebora flies overhead.

Sheik     : The Master Sword is a ship with which you can sail upstream and
downstream through time's river... The port for that ship is in
the Temple of Time...

To restore the Desert Colossus and enter the Spirit Temple, you must
travel back through time's flow... Listen to this Requiem of
Spirit... This melody will lead a child back to the desert.

* - Sheik readies a harp.

Sheik     : Play the Requiem of Spirit!

* - Perched atop a ledge, Gaebora observes. He departs as Link finishes playing
the music.

&lt;game&gt;    : You have learned the Requiem of Spirit!

* - Link tries to approach Sheik, but a sandstorm begins, so he shields his eyes
with a hand. Sheik disappears before the storm can subside.


Desert Colossus  -  Past  


* - Nabooru is standing by the small hole.

Nabooru   : I haven't seen you around, kid... What do you want?

-----------------------------------------------------------
-(To see the temple)
Nabooru   : You're just a kid! The temple is no place for kids!

-(Looking for the Sages)
Nabooru   : A Sage? I don't know anyone like that.

-(Nothing, really)
Nabooru   : You have nothing to do? What good timing! Can you do me a favor,
kid? Wait a second, I want to ask you first--you wouldn't happen
to be one of Ganondorf's...followers...would you?

--(What if I am?)
Nabooru   : Wha-ha-ha! Don't try to act cool, kid. I was just asking!
A kid like you could never be one of Ganondorf's followers!
Well, let's cut to the chase...

--(I hate Ganondorf!)
Nabooru   : Uh-huh! You've got guts. I think I like you.
-----------------------------------------------------------

* - After either of the options following "Nothing, really":

Nabooru   : First of all, let me introduce myself. I'm Nabooru of the Gerudos.
I'm a lone wolf thief. But don't get me wrong! Though we're both
thieves, I'm completely different from Ganondorf. With his
followers, he stole from women and children, and he even killed
people!

A kid like you may not know this, but the Gerudo race consists only
of women. Only one man is born every hundred years... Even though
our laws say that lone male Gerudo must become King of the Gerudos,
I'll never bow to such an evil man!

By the way, what is your name, kid? Link?! What kind of name is
that? Well...anyway...

I want to ask you a favor... Will you go through this tiny hole and
get a treasure that's inside? The treasure is the Silver Gauntlets.
If you equip them, you can easily push and pull very heavy things!

No, no, no, kid! Don't even think about taking this treasure for
yourself! The Silver Gauntlets won't fit a little kid like you if
you try to equip them! I want you to be a good boy and give them
to me!

Ganondorf and his minions are using the Spirit Temple as a hideout.
Only the Silver Gauntlets will allow me to sneak deep into the
temple. Once there, I'm going to steal all the treasure inside and
mess up their plans!

How about it? Will you do it?

-----------------------------------------------------------
-(Yes)
Nabooru   : Thanks, kid! You and I, let's give Ganondorf and his followers
a big surprise, shall we?

If you can successfully get the Silver Gauntlets... I'll do
something great for you!

-(No)
Nabooru   : Well, what did I expect? After all, you're just a kid!

* - When speaking to her again, she repeats from "I want to ask you a favor".
-----------------------------------------------------------

* - In a certain room, a message is displayed upon examining a sun-like object
with a face painted onto it.

Sun       : Show me the light!

* - A Bombchu must be used to destroy a rock on a wall, which is blocking
sunlight. When light touches the sun, it opens its eyes and smiles,
prompting a door to open.

* - Link eventually reaches the right hand of the colossus.

Gaebora   : Hey, what's up, Link? Surprised to see me?

A long time in this world is almost nothing to you, is it?
How mysterious! Even I thought that the tales of a boy who could
travel back and forth through time was [sic] merely a legend.

Link, you have fully matured as an adult. From now on, the future
of all the people in Hyrule is on your shoulders.

Maybe it's not my time anymore. Here is my last advice.

Two witches inhabit this temple. In order to destroy them, turn
their own magic power against them. Hoo hoot!

Do you want to hear what I said again?

* - "Yes" prompts him to repeat himself from "From now on". "No" prompts:

Gaebora   : I will continue to watch you... Hoo hoo hoo hoot!

* - He departs.

On the ledge, there is a treasure chest containing the Silver Gauntlets.

&lt;game&gt;    : You found the Silver Gauntlets! If you wore them, you would feel
the power in your arms, the power to lift big things with {A}!
But, these gauntlets won't fit a kid... Plus, you promised to give
them to Nabooru. You should keep your word...

Nabooru   : Hey! Where are you taking me?! Yeearggh! Let me go!!

* - Link looks down at the entrance to the temple, where two aged witches have
created a circle of purple light--which acts as quick sand--beneath Nabooru.

Nabooru   : You, you fiends! Ganondorf's minions!

Link! Get out of here! Now! These witches! They're using black magic
on me!

* - With Nabooru pulled entirely through the light, the witches fly into the
temple atop their broomsticks.


Desert Colossus  -  Future  


* - With the Silver Gauntlets, Link can now move the heavy stone block.

* - After some time, Link encounters the two witches, who are accompanied by an
Iron Knuckle of atypical design. The witch named "Kotake" has a blue jewel
on her forehead, while Koume's forehead bears an orange jewel.

Kotake    : Ho ho ho! Looks like someone is here, Koume.

Koume     : Hee hee hee! Looks like it, Kotake!

Kotake    : What an outrageous fellow he is, to intrude so boldly into our
temple... Ho ho ho!

Koume     : We should teach this outrageous fellow a lesson! Hee hee hee!

Oh, loyal minion... Destroy this intruder on our behalf!

* - They disappear.

The Iron Knuckle stands from the throne on which it had sat, and raises its
hands. The battle music abruptly stops as the enemy realizes that its hands
are empty. To remedy this, it snaps its fingers, causing a giant double-
sided axe to materialize from thin air.

Upon the enemy's defeat, its armor falls off--revealing Nabooru.

Nabooru   : Unnnh... Where am I...?

* - Koume and Kotake reappear.

Kotake    : Well, well... Looks like she's back to normal... Koume...

Koume     : She's just a little girl, but she commands a lot of respect among
te Gerudo, Kotake...

Kotake    : Maybe we should make we work for the great Ganondorf for a little
while longer! Ho ho ho!

Koume     : Then we should brainwash her again! Hee hee hee!

* - They launch magic at Nabooru, which teleports her out of the area.
The witches disappear again.

* - In a nearby room, upon climbing onto a high platform:

???       : Look at that stupid kid! He came on his own to offer himself as a
sacrifice to the great Ganondorf...

* - Circles of fire and ice appear, from which Koume and Kotake respectively
materialize.

Koume     : With my flame, I will burn him to the bone!

Kotake    : With my frost, I will freeze him to his soul!

* - The "Sorceress Sisters: Twinrova" circle about Link in the air.

After sufficient damage is dealt:

Koume     : OK, let's get serious now, Kotake!

Kotake    : Oh, OK, Koume.

&lt;both&gt;    : Kotake and Koume's Double Dynamite Attack!

* - They fuse into a single entity--Twinrova--with hair made of fire and ice,
holding two staves that correspond to an element. Twinrova winks at Link.

Upon Twinrova's defeat, Koume and Kotake separate.

Koume     : Shoot, what a fresh kid! This time, we'll get serious, right Kotake?

* - Halos appear above their heads, and a beam of light shoots down.

Kotake    : What? Hey, Koume, what is that above your head?

Koume     : I don't know, but you have one over your head too, Kotake!

* - They both briefly pause.

Koume     : But I'm only 400 years old!

Kotake    : And I'm just 380 years old!

Koume     : We're twins! Don't try to lie about your age!

Kotake    : You must have gone senile!

Koume     : Who are you calling senile?! Is that how you treat your older
sister?

Kotake    : We are twins! How can you be older!

Koume     : Keeeyaaah!! How heartless you are!

Kotake    : How can you be so ungrateful?

Koume     : You're heartless!!

Kotake    : You ungrateful...

* - They both settle down as they are pulled into the light.

&lt;both&gt;    : I'll come back to haunt you!

* - A circle of light appears on a platform. It takes Link to:


Chamber of the Sages  


* - Nabooru appears before Link.

Nabooru   : Kid, let me thank you. Heheheh...look what the little kid has become
in the past seven years--a competent swordsman!

By the way... I really messed up... I was brainwashed by those old
witches and used by Ganondorf to do his evil will... But isn't it
funny? That a person like me could turn out to be the Sage of
Spirit! And now, I'm going to fight them as one of the six Sages!
Heh heh... I'm going to pay them back for what they did to me!

Kid... No... Link, the Hero of Time! Instead of keeping the promise
I made back then, I give you this Medallion! Take it!

&lt;game&gt;    : You received the Spirit Medallion! Nabooru awakens as a Sage and
adds her power to yours!

Nabooru   : If only I knew you would become such a handsome man... I should have
kept the promise I made back then...

Rauru     : Link, the hero! Finally, all of us, the six Sages, have been
awakened! The time for the final showdown with the King of Evil
has come!

Before that, though, you should meet the one who is waiting for
you... The one who is waiting for you at the Temple of Time....



[02'25] ---        Ganon's Castle       --- [02'25] 




Hyrule Castle Town  -  Temple of Time  


Sheik     : I have been waiting for you, Link.

Link, the Hero of Time... You have overcome many hardships and
awakened six Sages. And now, you have a final challenge, a showdown
with Ganondorf, the King of Evil....

Before that...I have things I want to tell only to you.
Please listen.

Another unknown legend of the Triforce passed down by the shadow
folk, the Sheikahs....

If you would seek the sacred triangle, listen well... The resting
place of the sacred triangle, the Sacred Realm, is a mirror that
reflects what is in the heart...the heart of one who enters it...
If an evil heart, the Realm will become full of evil; if pure,
the Realm will become a paradise.

The Triforce...the sacred triangle...it is a balance that weighs
the three forces: Power, Wisdom and Courage. If the heart of the
one who holds the sacred triangle has all three forces in balance,
that one will gain the True Force to govern all. But, if that one's
heart is not in balance, the Triforce will separate into three
parts: Power, Wisdom and Courage.

Only one part will remain for the one who touched the Triforce...
the part representing the force that one most believes in. If that
one seeks the True Force, that one must acquire the two lost parts.
Those two parts will be held within others chosen by destiny,
who will bear the Triforce mark on the backs of their hands.

Seven years ago, Ganondorf, the King of Thieves, used the door you
opened in the Temple of Time and entered the Sacred Realm. But when
he laid his hands on the Triforce, the legend came true.

The Triforce separated into three parts. Only the Triforce of Power
remained in Ganondorf's hand. The strength of the Triforce of Power
enabled him to become a mighty, evil king, but his dark ambitions
were not satisfied. To gain complete mastery of the world, Ganondorf
started looking for those chosen by destiny to hold the two other
Triforce parts.

The one who holds the Triforce of Courage is... You, Link!

And the other, who holds the Triforce of Wisdom...is the seventh
Sage, who is destined to be the leader of them all...

* - The symbol of the Triforce appears upon the back of Sheik's left hand,
the lower-left triangle shining brighter than the others.

Light fills the room, resonating from the Triforce mark. As it fades,
Zelda appears in the place of Sheik.

Zelda     : It is I, the Princess of Hyrule, Zelda.

I apologize for meeting you in disguise, but it was necessary to
hide from the King of Evil. Please forgive me...

On that day, seven years ago, Ganondorf attacked Hyrule Castle.
I saw you as I was escaping from the castle with my attendant, Impa.
I thought I should entrust the Ocarina to you... I thought that
would be our best chance...

As long as you had the Ocarina in your possession, I thought
Ganondorf could never enter the Sacred Realm, but...something I
could never expect happened...

After you opened the door of time, the Master Sword sealed you away
in the Sacred Realm... Your spirit remained in the Sacred Realm...
and then the Triforce fell into Ganondorf's hands. he went on to
invade the Sacred Realm... Ganondorf had become the Evil King,
and the Sacred Realm became a world of evil. All of this is an
unfortunate coincidence.

I passed myself off as a Sheikah and hoped that you would return.
I waited for seven years... And...now you are back. The dark age
ruled by Ganondorf the Evil King will end!

The six Sages will open the sealed door and lure Ganondorf back
into the Sacred Realm. I will then seal the door to the Sacred Realm
from this world. Thus, Ganondorf the Evil King will vanish from
Hyrule.

Link... In order to do this, I need your courage again. Please
protect me while I do my part. And here is a weapon that can
penetrate the Evil King's defenses... The power given to the chosen
ones... The sacred Arrow of Light!!!

&lt;game&gt;    : You got the Light Arrow! Set it to {C} and your arrows will be
powered up! The light of justice will smite evil!

* - The temple begins to tremble.

Zelda     : That rumbling...It can't be!?

* - A crystal surrounds Zelda. Ganondorf transmits his voice.

Ganondorf : Princess Zelda...you foolish traitor!

I commend you for avoiding my pursuit for seven long years.
But you let your guard down... I knew you would appear if I
let this kid wander around!

My only mistake was to slightly underestimate the power of this
kid...

* - The crystal floats into the air.

Ganondorf : No... It was not the kid's power I misjudged, it was the power of
the Triforce of Courage! But, with the Triforce of Wisdom that Zelda
has... When I obtain these two Triforces... Then, I will become
the true ruler of the world!!

If you want to rescue Zelda, come to my castle!

* - The crystal disappears. Ganondorf laughs.


Ganon's Castle  


* - The castle floats above a pit of lava where Hyrule Castle once stood.

Rauru     : Link...can you hear me? It's Rauru, the Sage.

We six will gather our power to create a bridge to the castle
where Ganondorf dwells... The castle's keep, which is known as
Ganon's Tower, is protected by six evil barriers. Bring down the
six barriers and save Princess Zelda!!

* - A bridge appears, formed by light of the colors associated with each sage.

* - Upon the destruction of an object that sustains the barriers, the sage
associated with said object's color will appear before Link.

Rauru     : The Light Barrier is dispelled! Hurry!

Saria     : The Forest Barrier is dispelled! Hurry up, Link!

Darunia   : The Fire Barrier is dispelled! Hurry up, Brother!

Ruto      : The Water Barrier is dispelled! Hurry up!

Impa      : The Shadow Barrier is dispelled! Please save the Princess!

Nabooru   : The Spirit Barrier is dispelled! Hurry up, kid!

* - Ganondorf is playing an organ in the castle's highest room. Zelda is present
within the same crystal as before.

The Triforce marks on Link's and Zelda's hands glow. Ganondorf stops playing
the organ.

Ganondorf : The Triforce parts are resonating... They are combining into one
again... The two Triforce parts that I could not capture on that day
seven years ago... I didn't expect they would be hidden within you
two! And now, finally, all the Triforce parts have gathered here!

These toys are too much for you! I command you to return them to me!

* - He raises his right hand, the symbol of the Triforce glowing thereupon.
A stream of dark light surges towards Link.

Navi      : Link! I can't help you! Because of the waves of darkness, I can't
get close! I'm sorry, Link!

* - "Great King of Evil: Ganondorf" begins to hover in the air.

Upon defeating him:

Ganondorf : The Great Evil King Ganondorf...beaten by this kid?!

* - He coughs up blood.

Ganondorf : Link....!

* - Ganondorf conjours a blast of magic that destroys the roof and walls of
the room. Thereafter, he collapses.

The crystal containing Zelda disappears.

Zelda     : Ganondorf...pitiful man... Without a strong, righteous mind,
he could not control the power of the gods...and...

* - The castle begins to tremble violently.

Zelda     : Link, listen to me! This tower will collapse soon! With his last
breath, Ganondorf is trying to crush us in the ruins of the tower!
We need to hurry and escape!

Please follow me!

* - She begins to lead Link out of the castle. In a certain room, she is
surrounded by a circle of fire, which is extinguished upon the nearby
Stalfos' defeat.

Zelda     : Thank you, Link. Now, let's hurry!

* - Zelda and Link escape the castle shortly before it falls apart.

Zelda     : It's over...it's finally over...

Navi      : Link... I'm sorry I couldn't help you in the battle before!

* - A rumble is heard.

Zelda     : What is that sound?

* - As Link draws near the center of the floating island, a ring of fire
appears along its perimeter.

Ganondorf rises from the debris. He uses the Triforce of Power to assume
a form referred to as "Ganon" by Navi, in which he appears similar to a
large, anthropomorphic pig.

He knocks the Master Sword out of Link's hands, to the fire's exterior.

Navi      : There's no way he's going to hold me back again! This time,
we fight together!

* - Ganon eventually takes enough damage so as to collapse.

Zelda     : Link! The Master Sword is here! Hurry up!!

Use the Master Sword! Destroy Ganon with the sacred sword!

* - Link reclaims the Master Sword and resumes combat with Ganon.
Upon Ganon's next collapse, Zelda strikes him with magic.

Zelda     : I'm using my power to hold the Evil King! You use your sword and
deliver the final blow!

* - The Master Sword's blade glows momentarily.

Zelda     : Use the Master Sword! Destroy Ganon with the sacred sword!

* - Link drives the Master Sword through Ganon's throat.

Zelda     : Six Sages... Now!!

* - In the Chamber of the Sages:

Rauru     : Ancient Creators of Hyrule! Now, open the sealed door and send the
Evil Incarnation of Darkness into the void of the Evil Realm!!

* - The Sages become spheres of light and merge together, forming a portal
that consumes Ganondorf and drops him into an abyss.

Ganondorf : YOU... CURSE YOU...ZELDA! CURSE YOU...SAGES!! CURSE YOU...LINK!

Someday... When this seal is broken... That is when I will
exterminate your descendants!!

As long as the Triforce of Power is in my hand...

* - Link and Zelda appear as if to be standing in a sky.

Zelda     : Thank you, Link... Thanks to you, Ganondorf has been sealed inside
the Evil Realm! Thus, peace will once again reign in this world...
for a time.

All the tragedy that has befallen Hyrule was my doing... I was so
young...I could not comprehend the consequences of trying to control
the Sacred Realm. I dragged you into it, too.

Now it is time for me to make up for my mistakes... You must lay
the Master Sword to rest and close the Door of Time... However,
by doing this, the road between times will be closed...

Link, give the Ocarina to me... As a Sage, I can return you to
your original time with it.

When peace returns to Hyrule... It will be time for us to say
good-bye...

Now, go home, Link! Regain your lost time! Home... Where you are
supposed to be...the way you are supposed to be...

* - A circle of light surrounds Link as Zelda plays the Song of Time.

Zelda     : Thank you... Link... Good-bye....

* - The credits begin to roll as various places are displayed. Many of Hyrule's
inhabitants perform a celebration in Lon Lon Ranch, which the Sages observe
from Death Mountain.

Link appears in the Temple of Time as a child, with the Master Sword
returned to the Pedestal of Time. Navi departs through a window.

Link enters the courtyard of Hyrule Castle, seemingly unaccompanied by Navi.
Zelda, who had been looking into a window, turns to Link.

Story  


001 : The Great Deku Tree has summoned you! Please come with me!

002 : C'mon! Be brave! Let's go into the Great Deku Tree!

003 : The Great Deku Tree wanted us to go visit the princess at Hyrule Castle...
Shouldn't we get going?

004 : The girl from the ranch asked us to find her father...I wonder where he
is?

005 : I wonder where we'll find the princess in this big old castle?

006 : What would Saria say if we told her we're going to save Hyrule?

007 : Impa said that the Spiritual Stone of Fire is somewhere on Death Mountain.

008 : Let's go inside the Dodongo's Cavern using a Bomb Flower!

009 : Darunia said that a fairy lives on top of Death Mountain, didn't he?

010 : I wonder if Saria knows anything about the other Spiritual Stone?

011 : It seems Princess Ruto somehow got inside Jabu-Jabu's belly...

012 : You collected three Spiritual Stones! Let's go back to Hyrule Castle!

013 : Those people on the white horse...they were Zelda and Impa, weren't they?
It looked like they threw something into the moat!

014 : Let's go check inside the Temple of Time.

015 : Link... Try to keep moving!!

016 : Should we believe what Sheik said and go to Kakariko Village?

017 : I wonder what's going on in the forest right now... I'm worried about
Saria, too!

018 : That cloud over Death Mountain...there is something strange about it...

019 : An arctic wind is blowing from Zora's River...do you feel it?

020 : Those Iron Boots look like they weight a ton! If you wear those boots,
you may be able to walk at the bottom of a lake.

021 : Let's look for someone who might know something about the other Sages!

022 : Have you ever played the Nocturne of Shadow that Sheik taught you?

023 : The desert...that is where Ganondorf the Evil King was born. If we go
there, we might find something...

024 : The one who is waiting for us at the Temple of Time...it could be...

025 : We have to save Princess Zelda from her imprisonment in Ganon's Castle!


Environment  


[ General ]
001 : What's that?

002 : You need a key to open a door that is locked and chained.

003 : Hey... Isn't that the same design that's on the Door of Time?

004 : Strong iron bars are blocking the door. You can't open them with your
hands!

005 : You need a special key to open this door.

006 : There's a treasure chest here.

007 : It looks like that torch was burning not too long ago...

008 : Watch for the shadows of monsters that hang from the ceiling.

[ Inside the Deku Tree ]
009 : Look, look, Link! You can see down below this web using {C Up}!

010 : Look at this wall! The vines growing on it give it a rough surface...
Maybe you can climb it, Link!

011 : You can open a door by standing in front of it and pressing {A}.
Pay attention to what the Action Icon says. That's the blue icon at
the top of the screen!

012 : Look! Something is hanging up there! It looks like an old ladder!

013 : After you get into the water, if you hold down {A}. you can dive!
I bet there are some interesting things underwater!

014 : Stand next to this block and grab hold of it with {A}. While holding {A},
you can push or pull it. If you stand next to the block and press {A}
while pressing {Control Stick} towards the block, you can climb on top
of it. Pay attention to what the Action Icon says!

[ Dodongo's Cavern ]
015 : It looks like there are many lava pits around here, so watch your step!

016 : Wow! Look at all those Bomb Flowers! Is there any way you can set them
off all at once?

017 : You never know what will be around the corner in these narrow paths...
Use {Z} Targeting to always look in the proper direction. This is a
useful technique, isn't it?

018 : With that switch on, the moving platform goes higher. Now you can quickly
reach the second floor!

[ Inside Jabu-Jabu's Belly ]
019 : Something strange is covering the entrance. You must solve the puzzle in
this room to make the entrance open.

020 : Watch out, Link! Electricity is running through this &lt;red/blue/green&gt;
slimy thing!

021 : This switch... It doesn't look like you can press it down with your
weight alone. Link...

022 : The red slimy thing is gone! That must be because you cut the red tail!
Will that work with the other ones too?

023 : There's a switch beyond this wall!

[ Lost Woods ]
024 : From here on, we'll be going through some narrow passages! If you take it
slow, maybe you can sneak up on some enemies. Use {Z} Targeting to always
look in the proper direction. Set your view so you can see down the next
corridor before you turn a corner. Once your view is set, hold down {Z}
to sidestep around the corner. That way you won't be surprised by an enemy
waiting in ambush.

[ Forest Temple ]
025 : There are arrows painted on the floor!

026 : The fires on the torches are gone. Seems like the ghosts took them away!

027 : This corridor is all twisted!

028 : This...this is the same torch we saw at the entrance to the temple,
isn't it?

029 : This torch is lit...that means...

030 : Look, Link! A torch is lit! That's because you beat a ghost, isn't it?!

031 : Link, watch out! The ceiling is falling down!

032 : This switch is frozen!

[ Fire Temple ]
033 : Link, I hear Goron voices down below.

034 : This switch looks rusted.

035 : You can see down from here... Isn't that the room where we saw Darunia?

[ Ice Cavern ]
036 : This blue fire...it doesn't seem natural. Maybe you can use it for
something?

[ Water Temple ]
037 : Link! Be careful! Don't get swallowed by the vortexes!

[ Bottom of the Well ]
038 : I can hear the spirits whispering in this room... "Look for the eye
of truth..." That's what they are saying!

039 : This wall...it says something here... "Danger below..."
That's what it says.

040 : This wall...it says something here... "Danger above..."
That's what it says.

041 : The water flowing out of this statue is flooding the entire floor.

[ Shadow Temple ]
042 : Here...I can hear the spirits whispering in this room... "Those who have
sacred feet should let the wind guide them. Then, they will be led to the
secret path." That's what they are saying!

043 : This wall...it's saying something! It says: If you want to see a ferry
to the other world, come here...

044 : Link! This ship is sinking! Abandon ship! Get onto a safe platform!

[ Gerudo Fortress ]
045 : This is not the correct key... The door won't open!

002 : The forest is connected to many places! If you can hear my song, you must
be somewhere that is connected to the forest!

003 : I was so happy to hear that Mr. Darunia loved my song so much! I was even
happier to find out that it helped you on your quest, Link! Tee hee hee!

004 : Are you collecting Spiritual Stones? You have one more to find? You mean
the Spiritual Stone of Water, don't you? The Great Deku Tree once told me
that Kind Zora, ruler of Zora's Domain, has it...

005 : Link... I don't know what it is... I have this feeling of dread...
The Castle... Yes, something bad is happening at the Castle!

006 : What? Your ocarina sounds...different somehow... Have you been practicing
a lot, Link?

007 : Great! You're safe! I knew I would hear from you again! I'm in the Forest
Temple! The forest spirits were calling for help, so I went to check it
out... But it's full of evil monsters! Help me, Link!

008 : Link... At first, I didn't want to become the Sage of the Forest....
But I'm glad now. Because I am helping you to save Hyrule, Link!
Yes, I am!

{s  } That doesn't look anything like Mr. Dampé, huh?

{B  } What is that? It's something that hops around in a field...
I forgot what those things are called...

Dampé     :{KB } Huh?! Wha--! Oh, it's just a kid. Don't scare me like that!
I may not look like it, but I'm a very sensitive guy!

{SZG} I'm on duty now... If you want me to dig, don't bother me.

{s  } Do you know what kind of mask you're wearing...?
And you're still wearing it?

Kakariko Village  


[KA-008]  : I bred a new type of miniature Cucco! I call it the Pocket Cucco!
I don't get goose bumps from this baby.

Cuccos are very good at getting lazy, late-risers out of bed.
Haven't you heard of them before? It makes them very happy to crow:
CUCCKOOOO! especially when it wakes up a very heavy sleeper!

However, my Cucco is not entirely happy right now... You..., [sic]
You look like you're good at handling Cuccos. Here, take this egg.
After the Cucco hatches, bring it back to me after a while,
and I'll check out its mood.

What do you think? Will you try?

-----------------------------------------------------------
-(Yes)
&lt;game&gt;    : You borrowed a Pocket Egg! A Pocket Cucco will hatch from it
overnight. Be sure to give it back when you are done with it.

[KA-008]  : Please make my Cucco happy! OK?

-(No)
[KA-008]  : Oh, too bad...were you pecked by a Cucco when you were little?
-----------------------------------------------------------

* - At the next morning:

Navi      : Look! A chicken hatched from the egg you were incubating!
It's the miracle of life!

* - Talon is sleeping in a certain house. The Cucco can awaken him.

Talon     : What in tarnation? Can't a person get a little shut-eye around here?

Ingo took over Lon Lon Ranch and they call it Ingo Ranch nowadays.
I was kicked out of there, and look at me now! My girl, Malon,
still works at the ranch... I'm worried about her...

* - After having acquired Epona:

Did you save Malon? Thanks! I'm goin' back to the ranch, then!
Yeehah!

* - After the above:

[KA-010]  : That bearded guy went back to the ranch. He looked so happy!

[CT-011]  : That lazy man, he kind of reminded me of my little Richard...
What's that? You say you've never heard of my little Richard?
He was such a famous puppy! You seriously haven't heard of him?

[KA-008]  : Oh, your Cucco looks pretty happy! He must have awakened an
extremely lazy guy!

You're a good Cucco Keeper! I'll give you a rare, valuable Cucco,
if you're interested... Its name is Cojiro, and it used to be my
brother's Cucco. Its blue body is quite charming. It's so cute!

Since my brother has gone, it's strange, but Cojiro has stopped
crowing. Do you want to keep Cojiro?

-----------------------------------------------------------
-(Yes)
&lt;game&gt;    : You returned the Pocket Cucco and got Cojiro in return! Unlike other
Cuccos, Cojiro rarely crows.

[KA-008]  : My brother must have been very lonely...

-(No)
[KA-008]  : It looks as if you really like that other Cucco. OK, you can keep it
for a while.
-----------------------------------------------------------


Lost Woods  


* - The carpenter boss's son is present in Area 03.

Navi      : ?? No response. He's sleeping.

* - Upon presenting Cojiro, it crows, thereby catching the man's attention.

Crptr Son : Cojiro?  Why? Normally only a nice guy like me can tame you...
Which means... You... You must be a nice guy! Must be! You must be!!
Please Mr. Nice Guy! Please! Deliver this stuff to the old hag
in the potion shop in Kakariko Village! This will disappear if you
take too long, so you gotta hurry!

-----------------------------------------------------------
-(OK)
&lt;game&gt;    : You got an Odd Mushroom! A fresh mushroom like this is sure to
spoil quickly! Take it to the Kakariko Potion Shop, quickly!

Crptr Son : Hurry up, nice guy! Before it disappears, deliver it to that old
wench....

-(I can't)
Crptr Son : Oh, yeah. That's it! You aren't a nice guy after all!! Get away
from me!
-----------------------------------------------------------

* - If the mushroom expires:

Navi      : Oh, no! Time's up! The thing you were going to deliver has spoiled!
Let's try again!


Kakariko Village  


Granny    : Sniff sniff sniff... What a mysterious smell... You must have
something!

That bum! He had to go into the forest... ....I see. Hey, give it
to me now!

-----------------------------------------------------------
-(Yes)
Granny    : If you see that fool, give this to him. It is the strongest medicine
I have ever produced. However, this potion will not work on a
monster...

&lt;game&gt;    : You received an Odd Potion! You don't know what's going on between
this lady and that guy, but take it to the Lost Woods!

Granny    : They say that there is no medicine that can cure a fool...
I guess that's true...

-(No)
Granny    : How sad... I just need a little...
-----------------------------------------------------------

* - Subsequently:

Granny    : Ultimate potion! How about 100 Rupees?

-----------------------------------------------
-(Buy)
* - She provides a Blue Potion. If problems arise:

You don't have enough Rupees! Hee hee hee!

I'm sorry...I can't sell this to you unless you have a bottle to
put it in.

-(Don't buy)
If you change your mind, come back and visit me... Hee hee hee!
-----------------------------------------------


Lost Woods  


* - The carpenter boss's son is absent. [008] of Kokiri Forest is present.

[008]     : That guy isn't here anymore. Anybody who comes into the forest
will be lost. Everybody will become a Stalfos. Everybody, Stalfos.
So, he's not here anymore.

* - If the Odd Potion is presented, then she continues:

[008]     : Only is saw is left. Hee hee. That medicine is made of forest
mushrooms. Give it back!

-----------------------------------------------------------
-(Yes)
&lt;game&gt;    : You returned the Odd Potion and got the Poacher's Saw!
The young punk guy must have left this behind.

[008]     : Heh heh heh. Are you going to be... too? Heh heh!

-(No)
* - Nothing more is said.
-----------------------------------------------------------


Gerudo Valley  


Crptr Boss: Hey, that saw! It's mine! But... I thought I left that saw with my
old lady... Oh well...

My Biggoron tool broke, so I was going to Goron city to get it
repaired. Your coming here is great timing. Will you give me my saw?

-----------------------------------------------------------
-(Yes)
Crptr Boss: Good kid! Thanks! I'm sorry that I can't give you something as good
in return, but...take this anyway!

&lt;game&gt;    : You traded the Poacher's Saw for a Broken Goron's Sword!
Visit Biggoron to get it repaired!

-(No)
Crptr Boss: What?! You're a dirty, rotten thief!
-----------------------------------------------------------


Death Mountain Trail  


* - Biggoron is rubbing his eyes. Upon presenting the Broken Biggoron's Sword:

Biggoron  : That broken knife is surely my worrrrrrrrrrk... I really want to
repairrrrr it, but... But because of yesterrrrrday's errrrruption,
my eyes are irrrrrrrritated...

There are fine eyedrops in Zora's Domain... You will find them
if you go to see Kinnnnnng Zorrrrrra... Please go get the
eyedrrrrrrops...

-----------------------------------------------------------
-(Yes)
&lt;game&gt;    : You checked in the Broken Goron's Sword and received a Prescription!
Go see King Zora!

Biggoron  : I've been waiting forrrrr you, with tearrrrrrs in my eyes...
Please say hello to Kinnng Zorrra!

-(No)
Biggoron  : Awww nooooo... I'm finished... My eyes arrrrrre so itchy...
Owwwwww...
-----------------------------------------------------------


Zora's Domain  


King Zora : Ooh... This is... well... hmmm... Hmmm... Eye drops... You might say
we have them, you might say we don't... We do have the ingredients.
If you take the ingredients to the doctor at the lake laboratory,
he can make the drops for you. But you need to deliver them fresh...

Can you make it before they spoil?

-----------------------------------------------------------
-(Yes)
&lt;game&gt;    : You used the Prescription and received an Eyeball Frog! Be quick
and deliver it to Lake Hylia while it's cold!

-(No)
King Zora : Then you think they'll spoil before you can get there? It's not that
far if you make the connection on horseback...
-----------------------------------------------------------


Lake Hylia  


[002]     : Oh, wow! I haven't seen an Eyeball Frog like this since Zora's
Domain froze over! These eyeballs are so delicious! Tonight I will
cook fried eyeballs for the first time in a long time! Uhoy hoy
hoo houy hoy! Such great stuff! Please say thank you to King Zora!

Eh? What? These are for making Biggoron's Eye Drops? Oh, how
disappointing! You should have said so in the first place!

Here it is. This medicine doesn't have any preservatives in it.
So it won't last long at this temperature. Run as fast as you can
to Death Mountain. You're young--you can do it!

&lt;game&gt;    : You traded the Eyeball Frog for the World's Finest Eye Drops!
Hurry! Take them to Biggoron before they go bad!

[002]     : When you come back next time, don't forget to bring me a souvenir!


Death Mountain Trail  


Biggoron  : Rrrrreally? You brrrrought the eye drops? I'm so rrrrrelieved!
I'm going to use them rrrrrright now!

Wowwwwwwwwwwwwww!! This is stimulating! It's worrrrrking grrrrreat!
Now I can get back to my blade business! My worrrrrk is not verrry
consistent, so I'll give this to you so you won't forrrrget.

Afterrrr a few days... Please returrrrrrn... Wait, just wait
patiently...

&lt;game&gt;    : The Biggoron's Sword... You got a Claim Check for it! You can't wait
for the sword to be completed!

Biggoron  : Not yet... Hey you... You arrrre impatient...

* - On the third day from the acquisiton of the Claim Check:

Biggoron  : I maaaade thissss... Trrrrade for claimmm checkkk...

* - Upon presenting the Claim Check:

Biggoron  : That sworrrrd is my finest worrrrk!

&lt;game&gt;    : You handed in the Claim Check and got the Biggoron's Sword!
This blade was forged by a master smith and won't break!

* - When speaking to him again, he repeats "That sworrrrd is my finest worrrrk!"

Link retains the Claim Check. Upon presenting it to Biggoron:

Biggoron  : I giiiive thissss to yoooou forrr a souvenirrrrr.
